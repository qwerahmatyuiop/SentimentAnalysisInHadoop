#admirationDear Kuya Chinito,OMG, Nakakakilig ka!! ANGCUTEMO po! Hindi pa tayo nagkakakilala, actually, pero lagi kitang nakikita. Ang cute mo grabe, I really want to know more about you. Lalo na nung one time, nagkatitigan tayo, naghihintay ka ata ng jeep nun? Di ko sure, pero bigla akong umalis kasi nahihiya ako sayo lumapit sayo. Grabe, sorry ah, shy-type talaga ako. I asked around kasi gusto talaga kita maging friend, ang interesting mo po kasi. Sabi saken nung isa kong friend Darel or Darren ata name mo, pero di kita makita sa facebook eh. Tapos I found out na taga-AISEC ka pala. Yung lang alam ko sayo as of now. Nakita din kita nung enrollment eh, black po yung shirt mo   wala lang, cute, haha! I didnt see you kanina eh (Kuya chinito, sana magkakilala tayo someday  -PeachMangoPie,2012, CBA
#admirationSa malayo, parang ang panget mo.Pero di naman pala, cute ka pala habang tumatagal akong nakatitig.May glasses ka, mukha kang Betty la Fea, pero feel ko ang ganda mo eh. Di kita kilala masyado, pero nakikita kita lagi. Civil Eng ka ata. Nicole ata? Di ko alam anong year eh, pero siguro 1st or 2nd.Ang ganda ng hair mo, kahit may pulang highlight na di nakatago.Ang ganda ng mata mo, yung parang iiyak ka na anytime. Sana tanggalin mo na glasses mo pag nabasa mo tong postPeroNaaalala ko ang Pear Fruit pag nakatalikod ka, bat ganun?Kung ang iba, ang ganda ng future, ikaw, yung past mo. HahaSexy mo. Pero ang nagpapasexy talaga sayo ay ang kabaitan mo.Mukha kang rockstar. D-New Found Lover, 201x, Engg

#crushconfeCrush kita Ralen ****** (ayoko sabihin last name . First time tayong nagkausap siguro tungkol sa isang homework, nagpapatulong ako sayo kasi ang galing galing mo sa subject na yun. umaasa pa rin ako na magtatagpo ulit ang ating mga landas. Cute cute mo kasiOo, alam ko simpleng crush-shoutout lang to pero gusto ko lang ilabas, happy crush lang naman, pero sana sa susunod ulit hindi na hihi. -Ink, 200*, Science
#crushconfeIt was the night before long exam ng isang subject ko. Inanyayaan ako ni crush na lumabas at manood ng play. Isa ksi yung roommate niya sa mga cast. Exam yun sa Theatre 100 [if I can remember properly].Ang saya ko talaga nun. Pinag-isipan ko pa kung magpapalit ako, magdedress ba ako or magpapants since malamig dun sa avr, or kung mauuna na akong magdinner kasi baka di pa siya kumain. Well, nauna na akong kumain [lol].Sabi niya pupuntahan niya ako by 7. Naghintay ako dun sa meeting place namin. 715 na, wala pa rin siya, tas bigla siyang nagtext na kakain daw muna siya.730, dumating na siya... may kasamang babae. </3 Close na close sila, bigla akong nahiya sa kanila. Di ko alam anong sasabihin. Parang... parang di ako makapasok sa mundo nila eh, tas medjo bingi pa ako kasi mahilig ako sa maingay. HahahaPero okay lang. Sanay na ako maging third wheel. Masakit pero okay lang. Nakasagot pa rin naman ako ng maayos sa exam. >         Dito ko nalang din ibubuhos yung tinatago ko sa first 5 months ko dito sa UP. [Actually mej kalat na siya sa block pero whatever. Mag-assume ako na di pa alam ni ex-crush.] Here it goes...Para dun kay ex-crush, sana masaya ka palagi and sana dapat mas nag-usap tayo nung 1st sem kasi parang malabo na na magkikita pa tayo muli. Chos. Hahaha. Pero yun, ang cute mo lang talaga. Di ko matiis yung mga mata mo. Parang kumikinang. Tapos yung ngiti mo talaga, nakakatunaw. Di na tuloy ako makapag-react nang maayos. HahahaTuwing natutulog ka sa Geol class nakaka-kalma talaga ako habang nakatingin sayo. Para kang baby na natutulog tas ang sarap tlga ng tulog mo nun. @_@ Ang saya ko rin kapag nasasabi ko sayo na na-notice ko bagong haircut mo. Pero, kahit ano itsura ng buhok mo, cute ka pa rin pTuwang-tuwa rin ako nung birthday mo tas mga 11 pm na ako nakapag-greet. ( Di ko talaga ineexpect na magrereply ka. Sabi mo okay lang at nagpasalamat ka kasi naalala ko. Ang proud ko pa nun kasi hindi ako tumingin sa fb nun pAlso, yung reply mo dun, it was the first text message you sent to me na may smiley     Hahay, crushes... the smallest things matter.Anyway, ang dami ko pa sanang gustong sabihin, pero never mind na. ^_^-Ex-crushed,2013, CS
#crushconfeJasmin Dalusong Of CBA,Una pa lang kitang makita, alam kong crush na kita. Gumawa ako ng paraan upang malaman ko ang pangalan mo noon.Pangalawang beses tayong nagtagpo mahal na kita. Sa mga sumunod Tuwing nakikita kita naninigas ako at di makagalaw ng maayos Dahil siguro sa kaba.  lagi kita pinagmamasdan lalo na ang iyong mga labi na mala-angelina jolie ang dating. Sana ay magkausap tayo kahit sandali lang ng mapahayag ko nararamdaman ko sayo.Alam kong tayo ang tinadhana dahil nakasabay kita sa jeep isang beses. Nakita din kita kumakain sa kfc. Nakasabay kita bumili ng gamit sa savemore. Tadhana ito. Alam ko at sigurado ako. PS alam kong kasama mo pa din ang kuya mo lagi pero handa naman ako magpakilala sa kanya at ipagpaalam kita ng maayos  (tutal magiging kuya ko din naman sya -darkbutterfly,2010, Business Administration
#crushconfessionTo Kuyang CHK Student Council 12-13,Alam mo, akala ko talaga nung una mataray ka. Pero nung nakausap kita at nginitian mo ako, shet halos matunaw ako! Ang gwapo mo, sarap kainin ng abs mo, magaling ka sa martial arts (itago nalang natin sa sport na tinatawag na taekwondo , mabait ka, smart, at ang tawa mo. Grabe, ano ba ang wala sayo?Di tayo close pero lagi lita nakikita sa CHK nun. Kaso nagpracticum ka na at sobrang busy mo. Kaya di na ako nagkaroon ng chance na makilala ka pa. Buti nalang kaibigan ko ibang kasama mo sa CHK SC nun kaya kahit papaano may balita ako tungkol sayo.Sana masaya ka naman sa trabaho mo ngayon sa 360 fitness club. Sana mabisita mo na ulit ang CHK kasi miss na miss na kita at ang masarap mong katawan. Naway maging masaya ka sa trabaho mo ngayon.Hope to see you soon! ; -Tigang4Ever, 2010-*****, CHK
#freerideNoong unang panahon, CAL pa yung college ko at hindi CMC...Taliwas sa pamumuhay ng Freshie, 18units ang 1st yr, first sem ko dahil pinilit ako mag-major ng adviser naging 7-8AM and 4-530 yung TTH ko at sa Wala akong dorm nearby kaya sari-sari na yung pagtambay pegs ko bilang Freshie.... Then came FREE RIDE...Ayun, dahil sa dami ng time, sumasakay ako ng TOKI at IKOT at bumababa kung saan ako sumakay in the name of pagkakabisado ng Halls and streets kasi sabi nila we dont really remember landmarks that way so i took the challenge. Sayang din yung free ride nuh!Sa mga drivers ng Toki at Ikot na hindi makaparada or makapahinga dahil pasahero pa ako, sorry po *chichay gesture*And that was how i celebrated my Centennial Freshie-ness! Sana magkafree ride sa Monorail balang araw tapos freshie sa masters naman ang Peg ko   - CentennialDoraGrepa,2008, CMC
#goodguyGaling kasi akong CHK non. kakatapos lang ng PE ko. Tapos next subject ko sa NIGS pa eh late nagdismiss yung prof namin tapos sumakto pa na may exam ako non. Sa pagmamadali kong sumakay ng jeep at sa sobrang haggard. sinuot ko yung ID ko at narealize ko na lang nung 3/4 of the way na yung jeep papuntang NIGS. basang basa tuloy ng pawis yung ID lace so tinanggal ko at pinatong sa lap ko. Kinakabahan ako sobra na baka malate ako sa exam eh hindi nagpapapasok ng late prof ko. Kaya pagkapara ko sa may NIGS, bumabagal pa lang yung jeep at hindi pa talaga humihinto tumayo na ko at bumaba. Takbo agad ako. Tapos may kumalabit sa kin. Yung kuyang katapat ko sa jeep. Nalaglag ko pala yung ID ko pagtayo at ihinabol niya sakin. Tinatawag niya raw ako kaso hindi ko narinig sa pagmamadali ko. Nag thank you ako ng sobra sa kanya at bumalik na siya sa abangan ng jeep para sumakay ulit.Kay kuyang bumaba pa ng jeep para ihabol yung ID ko. kung sino ka man, maraming maraming maraming salamat.

I use the search function of Google Spreadsheet and type in the correct answer to the verification question. I prioritize confessions from UP students, and if I have time to spare, thats when I check the other submissions. Most of the time, I schedule posts from non-UP students in the morning.- Kuya (P.S.

#metaGuys, may mga konting katanungan lang ako at nais kong hingin ang inyong opinyon.1. Gusto ninyo bang lagyan ng time stamp ang mga posts?2. Gusto ninyo bang maging mas active ang admins sa pagcomment? Kasi sinasadya naming hindi maging masyadong active sa comments kasi iniiwasan naming mapunta ang spotlight sa amin, at sa posts lang sana ang focus ng readers.3. May maisusuggest ba kayo para maimprove ang submission form? So far nagwowork yung ginawa naming paglagay ng verification kasi mas madaling ifilter at iprioritize yung submissions from UP students (NOTE syempre nagpopost din kami ng mga submissions from non-UP students .4. Gusto ninyo bang pagsamahin na lang ulit ang Crush Confessions at TDF?Maraming salamat!-Kuya

Dahil mahaba ang bakasyon, pinanood ko ulit yung buong ATLA at LOK habang naghihintay sa bagong season. Naalala ko rin noong bata pa ako, tinry kong mag-earthbending. Ginagaya ko yung mga stance sa palabas at pinipilit na pagalawin yung lupa. Then I realized na non-bender pala ako. LolPS May upcoming game ang Legend of Korra.

Tapos di mo na siya makikita ulit at makakalimutan mo yung itsura nya. Pero alam mo na maganda sya. At alam mo na wala kang kahit anong intensyon dahil nasa isang relasyon ka na.

Ang sarap sa pakiramdam tuwing may madudukot akong kulangot everytime na pinapasok ko daliri ko sa ilong ko. Tapos may iba-ibang types na kulangot akong nakukuhaFlaky - mejo tuyo. Masarap itong ikisikis sa mga dingding ng ilong. Maganda pag nangangati ang ilong.Well-done - yung tipong sakto lang. Masarap paglaruan o kaya ipitik sa isang target.Slime - malagkit at mamasa-masa. Messy siyang tanggalin.Nireregla - yung kulangot na may makikita kang dugo. Either tuyo or fresh pa yung dugo.Marami pa atang types yun e. Masaya kung combination yung makukuha mo. Masarap makakuha nung flaky tapos may karugtong na slime. At di lang ako kuntento na laruin siya. Pag katapos kong lamasin ilalagay ko uli sa ilong ko tapos dudukutin ko uli for later use. Nalulungkot ako pag aksidente kong nasinga yung dineposit ko. Sayang.Kumakain ako ng kulangot nung bata ako. Ngayon nawala na ata yung appetite ko. Pero balita ko nakakapag-boost daw ng immune system yung kulangot. Haha. Kaya siguro di ako madalas magkasakit.- booger canon,2010, Science

When we were claiming such pillows, I saw that the company was the infamous Philippine Prudential Life.I wanted to be polite so I backed out gently, giving vague excuses. And then he asked me, UP ka no? A quick yes and then he gave me to his manager, a less likable woman. She still tried to convince me so I started badgering her about another friends traumatic encounter with their company, how the machines were pre-programmed for you to win then you would be psychologically coerced to avail of an insurance plan, etc.The mgr couldnt look me in the eye anymore, and another lady seemed to come to the rescue and asked, OK na ba?

Dear ate na clerk sa 7-11 SU,Ate I first encountered you nung nasa 7-11 agapita pa kayo. You had straight cut bangs and colored contacts. Napaka friendly, courteous, and helpful niyo, and hanggang ngayon na nasa SU na po kayo at short na ang hair nyo. Youre probably the best employee Ive met at any convenience store or any store, period. You seem like such a nice and helpful person and nakaka inspire kayo. I admire your commitment to your job and your integrity. Sana narereap nyo ang benefits ng pagiging masipag at matulungin nyo.Lagi akong bumibili sa 7-11 dahil nakaka cheer up po kayo. Kanina may dala akong gamit na mejo mahirap dalhin kasi walang handle at binigyan mo ako ng 7-11 na plastic bag para hindi ako mahirapan. I didnt ask for it, but you were observant and empathetic. Its small things like these that really matter.Hahaha, sana makita nyo po to. I really commend you for being awesome! \m/-HappyCustomer, CAS, 201*

Last friday, one of my classmates had some sort of a heated argument with my proff about the  KULO exhibit. My proffs point is art should have boundaries and my classmate thought that it was indeed art and must not be censored.After some arguments, my proff finally continued the discussion at hand which was about growth of civilizations, then one of its proof is said to be the flourishing of art.Upon mentioning the word  art binalik niya na naman yung about sa exhibit.One of my classmates then wrote  Hindi makaget-over si Sir! and we silently giggled. What do you think guys?

Never assume unless otherwise stated.Ive been living with that motto for years now. Its my way of avoiding being one of those umaasa. But why does he have to make me coil up and forget those 5 words?To be completely, he wasnt the most handsome guy on our campus (although he claims he is . Yet, his talent, his sense of humor and his wit charmed me. He wasnt even that smart - his grades werent that high. But the way he shreds the guitar with passion in his eyes compensated everything he was lacking.We were just in our NF days when he started treating me like I was special. He didnt treat me the way he did with our other girl friends. He walked me back to my dorm after we did our project at his apartment and walked me to my classes. He treated me at Mcdonalds even though it was his last cash. He even accompanied me to dinner even though he really didnt eat. Our friends noticed that and has started asking me about us. I didnt know what to say. Then, just last February, he asked me out on a date. And then, he said he was just kidding. Lokohan ba to?Do you even like me?Or do you just treat your girl friends like that?Naga-assume lang ba ako?- Buang, CAS, 20**

Sabihin nyo na pong mayabang ako or may pa-humble effect pa akong nalalaman, pero ito po ang pinaka-ayaw ko sa lahat. Hindi po ako mayaman, ang parents ko po ay hindi rin ganoon kayaman. Simpleng pamilya lang po kami na kayang tustusan ang pang-araw araw na pangangailangan at kayang bilhin ang ilan sa mga kagustuhan. Wala naman po yatang Caste System dito sa UP. Kahit na may bracket bracket pang nalalaman ang tuition fee, hindi pa rin po itong maituturing na Caste System. Kaya po sa mga taong kung maka tingala sa mga RK na estudyante, pare-pareho lang po tayo sa UP. Hindi pa man po ako pumapasok, alam ko po na sa bawat professor na makakasalamuha nating lahat, kahit na Bracket A ka or Bracket E2 ka or kahit anong bracket na may discount sa tuition fee, may sisingko parin at may uuno.

Since trend ang posts about UP Naming Mahal..When I worked for a government sports body three years ago, I had the privilege to watch unlimited UAAP games. The basketball freak that I really am plus libre pa, lahat ng games ng Maroons ay pinanood ko, kahit bawat laro ay kinakantyawan ako ng officemates ko about the trend ng UP game results. Kahit na ligwak tayo sa ending ng bawat laro (yes, it was a winless season for us , I would still proudly leave the game venue. Haha. Salamat sa huling parte kung saan inaawit ang school hymn ng bawat team. Muling nabubuo ang nademoralize kong pagkatao sa laro, pagkatapos ng taas-kamao at noo na pag-awit ng UP Naming Mahal.I guess thats how it really feels, when you sing it from the heart. <3 ^^

Some of you might find it disgusting but its true, I am turned on just by thinking and touching animals (farm  genitals.Tulad na lamang nung isang beses naming mag-farm activity sa ANSC 1 where we need to measure the HRT of the farm animals. First is the pig, dahil maliit pa lang siya, I manage to catch it and I got the chance to play with its penis. While holding its flank when counting its respiration rate,  my pinky finger slowly touches the small member, and I played with it the whole time. The second one is doon naman sa cattle sa dairy farm. while inserting the thermometer doon sa anus ng cow, pasimple kong hinihimas yung vulva nito. Thank God hindi siya umihi. And I am very turned on by that instance. And my best experience is the chicken naman,when we are  to dress it. May part doon na we have to remove the internal organ of the carcass through the anus. And FUCK! its so warm that before and after I took out the internal organ, I fingered the chicken like I was fingering myself. Honestly, I could feel that by doing that I am satisfying my sexual urges that I nearly cum during our class.And my last experience was in ANSC 2 when milking the cow! Holy Cow! I was really turned on by holding the udder, its so warm and a little bit slimmy.P.S. I bought a puppy near the gate, and it is not only my pet, my bestfriend, but also my toy.-pet lover CEM 2012
Somehow, getting UP students to be collectively fanatical about something, even if it wasnﾒt basketball, ran against the grain of UP culture. In a way, it was a contradiction, but an amusing one the essence of the UP school spirit was to not take the UP school spirit too seriously...We never needed to be coached or indoctrinated about loving our alma mater.

The timeline ever since yesterday.April 201243 AM - First time kaming nagkita as strangers sa chat sa Omegle.200 AM - Meetup sa tapat ng White House700 PM - Natulog siya sa apartment ko. Before that, we talked a lot.0300 PM - Nagising kami, made her lunch0400 PM - We stared into each others eyes0600 PM - After staring into nothingness we kissed.0718 PM - We connected and started the relationship.At dun nga nagsimula.  And so one of our philosophical ramblings were about the time that we had shared. We only met for a day, but she was a hipster. A very very very weird one and because of that and stuff like YOLO, why not? We shared everything, why not be perfect?Who does not want a fast start yet a long lasting one? Cheers to us monster!  - ShesGonnaKillMeForBraggingThis, CAS, 2010-*****
There is HOPEFor every hectic work day there is a quiet rest...For every painful experience there is a healing touch...For every negative feeling there is an abiding joy...For every disappointment there is a certain hope...For every turbulent storm there is a sure foundation...For every doubting thought there is a calm assurance...For every hurtful action there is a forgiving love.In all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us.

This Vinceton Post article really irked me. We owe this current economic crisis to capitalism - and all those capitalists out there who work in the name of greed.His rants about education not being a right - spoken like a true ignoramus who goes through his life with blinders on.
This is for another CamilleBS Nutri Batch 12The very moment I saw her, I was mesmerized. I already had a chance to meet her way back before but I was surprised that I was given a chance to be one of her classmates this previous semester. So heres my confession.Panakaw na tingin. Panandaliang sulyap. Palihim na ngiti.Im already contented doing that every time I am with her. I was always staring to this lovely girl who has an angelic yet seductive smile. She doesnt know how she makes my heart beat. She doesnt know how she makes me happy. She doesnt know how much Ive fallen for her. I like her but she doesnt have any clue and I dont think Ill be having another chance to be with her. Last semester was a gift. A gift given by chances. And now it saddens me how reality bites. I can no longer see this pretty girl as often as I see her last semester. I will no longer see that charming smile. I will no longer hear that sweet melodious voice. I will no longer feel that unusual cadence of my heart beat.I am hoping that she read this. Just to let her know. That someone like me exist from her flock of admirers. Shes smart and kind. Its not easy not to fall in love with her.-Foie Gras, CHE, 201*-****

This is why I hate pa-cool na orgs. I am not generalizing, I love cool; pero some cool is too cold it can leave you in frostbite.I applied for an organization during my freshman days, it was the time when the issue about freshman recruitment was hot. Scorching hot. This organization, well, they call their organization an academic organization but I do not see the academics in them. I mean, really. During my application there were all like Prove us you are worth being one of us. Im sort of, yeah, probably I can do things to be a member, but things got worse. During my reporting days, Ive seen not-so-good things from them. Adding up my inis towards bossy people (especially power trippers  na wala naman sa lugar, it all intensified when they made people roll and do physical things while reporting. I have had several reporting though, I tried to minimize those physical things for my sake, I wont do anything hurtful for me just to be a goddamn member of that org. But heres the catch, I quit. Why? Things got overboard. Sleepless nights because of too much requirements for weeks and sacrificing academic work just for my mates.I quit. Yes, I am a quitter. I would not forsake everything just to be a part of your org because I went halfway through and it is sayang. I quit because I do not believe in whatever is inside your org. You were just so good on your facade but inside, you are rotting! Rotting like a meatball poured with maggots and black molds!And, if you are going to paddle someone, make sure your members wont tell anyone. It was oh-so-nice-and-clear when I tried reverse psychology to my supposed blockmate. I told them (singular  that my other supposed-to-be batchmate said there was a paddle and they (singular  affirmed it even if it did not really happen that supposed-to-be batchmate said it to me. Gotcha!So much for an org. Choose your orgs wisely, kids. Dont get hurt just to belong. You are more than that.-Meathook GS 20**

Tips sa pagpili ng password Dapat mahirap mahulaan ng iba pero madali nyong matandaan. Halimbawa may kakilala ako na kapag nag pa password ay madali lang. Yung mga ginagamit nyang password ay mga words gaya ng destiny, happy, peace.Wag tularan. Ako pag pumipili ng password sentence ang ginagamit ko. Example the sentence is There are infinitely many lines passing through a given point.  kaya ang password ko ay  tr8mlptag.  pero pinalitan ko na...sentence uli sya para mahirap mahulaan.

UPLBThe plan of Chancellor Velasco is to simply wait. Wait until the UPLB is swarming with NF who barely knows the life of a small class. By that time, the number of UPLB students who fight against LLCP will decrease until no one will even know about it. The Chancellor is very smart, just like GMA.

  I know this vid is also biased and ignorant on some important facts. but it does have some interesting points.A. A major reason why EDSA wasnt Rwanda because Marcos ordered the military not to shoot anyone showing any bit of aggression.B.

read this one This just came in from my orgs contact with a staff ng Kabataan party list. Apparently the proposed 2011 budget by the government will see UPs budget slashed by 1.38B pesos.

The Office of the Student Regent also has a copy. can any one have this confirmed soon?

Hello sa Fubu ko!  Thank you dahil kahit medyo masakit nung una, pinagtiyagaan mo pa din ako.Thank you kase inaantay mo talaga akong makaraos. Thank you kase kahit san ko gusto gawin, pumapayag ka. Mapakotse, hotel, bahay o sa fast-food man.Tangina ang sarap ng ginagawa natin pero mas masarap kasi ikaw ang kasama ko. Tipong napapatirik ako ng mata pag sobrang sarap.. ang galing mo kase eh! Bilib na talaga ko sayo!Hindi ako makapaniwala na aabot tayo ng four years! Dati, food buddy lang kita na kahit masira ang tiyan ko at namimilipit ako sa sakit, tinutulungan mo pa din ako at pinagtiyatiyagaang alagaan; na pag jumejebs ako, kahit inaantok kana, no pressure, inaantay mo akong makaraos sa kalbaryo ko; na kahit san ko trip kumain, para kang Globe, go lang ng go. Ngayon, mas lalo pa kitang minahal. Yung mga pagkaing kinakain natin, mas sumasarap kasi ikaw ang kasabay ko pagkain. Ang galing mo kasing pumili ng kakainan! Fubs, I love you so much!

Okay, first time to. Mejo nakaka-kaba. Isa din ako sa dakilang basher ng TDF. Iyong iba naiinis na sa akin kasi minsan wala na sa katwiran pero sorry talaga di ba? Ang benta kasi sa inyo ng mga walang sense na-comments kaya ayon todo bigay ako. Enjoy na enjoy yung iba. Sa pagtambay ko sa TDF marami akong nakakasalamuha, may mga #notfromUp pero minsan din taga-UP na mismo, ayos lang naman. Exciting nga e! Mediyo nagsasawa na din ako sa mga kakilala ko. Gusto ko din kasi ng kaibigan na taga-UP. So ayun nga, one time may nakausap akong taga-UP. Actually, siya iyong nag-PM.. Di ko makakalimutang sinabi niya ay nakuha ko daw ang pagkakaroon ng UP Sentiments. Ako naman ang laki ng ngiti. Syempre taga-UP yun. Compliment mula sa isang taga-UP. Astig!Pero ang ikinabigal ko at recently ko lang nalaman na professor/instructor pala yung nakausap ko. Kung di ko pa titingnan yung mga comment sa pictures niya, di ko talaga malalaman. Sobrang hiya ko nang malaman ko iyon. Hindi kasi halata e. Wala sa DP niya. Grabeng hiya yung nararamdaman ko. Dami sigurong prof. na pagala gala sa TDF kaya mag-iingat na ako sa mga sasabihin ko.Kaway kaway kay Kuya?Sir Franco. Galing mo sir!  Bunso2012, NotfromUPD
#BracketA02.12.13I like seeing A on my form 5. I like being bracket A and being called rich kid.I like it because it reassures me and makes me believe that my family and I are and will be fine; that we still have a lot of blessings to be thankful for; that were not having trouble in paying tuition. It makes me forget.I feel my mom (shes a single working mom  slowly... you know. Shes become older and more prone to illnesses. Im terrified of the c-word. Shes recovering now, but one day she may not be able to pay for her medical expenses while supporting me and my siblings. Shed have to make a choice, and I know what choice shed make. I cant even bear to think about that.When people call me rich, I am able to escape. Its a form of assurance for me that things are okay and will be okay, even it seems unlikely.I turn to others to convince me that Im well-off because I cantﾗnot when you go home to a house where all conversations end in how expensive everything is becoming, how much debt needs to be paid off, how much tighter our belts need to be, and how we really need to start a savings account but cant.I may be bracket A on paper, but thats all there is. Everything my mom earns goes directly to our expenses, and I only have nice things because of generous relatives that I will never be able to thank enough.I find solace in other peoples affirmation of my being rich because I know wholeheartedly that I cant say it to myself and mean it, and God knows Ive tried. I know its shallow, but let me stay in this make-believe world of mine; one day I wont be someones little princess anymore, and I wont be able to stop it.So, please, call me rich kid and maybe then I can play along, too. Maybe I can forget just a little bit.i will always be your little princess,2012, Engineering

#LowiltonMirasolHello Sir Low!I just had to say it out loud to let the world know how much I admire you! <3I was in one of your Math17 classes and I must say you are a blessing to my life. Ever since I have always been afraid of Mathematics but during our class I never felt fear except during the first day where you imposed a lot of rules and it felt like I was going to through a horrible semester taking Math17 with a terror prof. But damn, when you started discussing the topic on sets I was like, ﾓGod he is brilliant.ﾔ. You teach Math in way that caters to those that are hated by the subject, like me. You are very brilliant, intelligent yet you are able to convey Math to a level that allows a student to understand and appreciate Math. You are amazing sir. And all throughout that semester our Math17 class was the only subject I would die before missing. (Sana wala ng large class, para 4 days tayong nagkikita nun and as if may natutunan ako sa large class/comedy bar. Days, months passed I started to admire more than just as my instructor. I know (if mababasa mo ito  sasabihin mo na naman, ﾓAko magugustuhan? Ang pangit ko kaya.ﾔ, as this is a famous line you always say in class pag pinagtritripan ka namin with your lovelife. Peace sir. But on a serious note, with all honestly, trust me sir hindi po talaga kayo pangit. You are cute and adorable. Please lang maniwala ka.  *wink* You have this aura that has caught the romantic side of me. <3Nung natapos po ang semester, I was so sad. Hindi naman po tayo masyadong close sa class so I had no reason to come visit you sa office nyo unlike my other classmates. So to sort of keep in touch, stalker nalang po ako sa FB ninyo. My home page is your profile page. I know you have been through a lot especially after your break-up and how I was wish I had the courage to tell you then that I am just here for you. But hindi ko kinaya and I kept my distance.  Para po dun sa ex niyo, too bad for her, sinayang niya ang pagmamahal ninyo. She doesnﾒt deserve you po. You deserve to be loved by someone that is willing to give you her all and hindi po kayo ipagpapalit sa mga friends niya. Itﾒs her loss po. And donﾒt worry sir, may inilaan po si Lord (though hindi kayo super religious, tama po ba?  para sa inyo. SANA AKO! <3Finally po sir, I just want you to know that I will always be here for you. Sana magkaroon po tayo ng pagkakataon sa future na magkakilala, maging friends at sana more than friends. Good luck po sa lahat sir, especially sa Korea trip! Aja! <3 I love you, sir Low! <3#StartingOverAgain-I<3SirLow,2012, Science

#SPGI have Bird Watching as my PE class for this sem kaya naman I will share something related to it. It was at the AS mens cr 3rd flr and around 6 pm. I saw this guy na hindi naman ganun ka gwapo or cute pero there is something na naattract ako sa kanya. Ayun he was peeing at one of the urinals at ako naman ay pumuwesto malapit sa kanya. Lumalabas ang manyak side ko by trying to peek at his birdie bird.... una i can only see the pubes pero parang gumanda ang view I saw everything tapos from tweety bird naging big bird na siya... I looked at him and he was smiling at me. Shocks lumabas talaga ang libog ko I was on the verge of touching it and having a sausage fest when someone comes by. Ayun naputol...lumabas na si guy.Kung nababasa mo po ito kuya big bird, if interested ka just smile at me pag nagkasalubong tayo. Dont worry I will be a good bird watcher na!DiscreetGayCutie,2009, CSSP

We have this trick to seduce girls (especially the ones who likes yaoi  and guys. We do french kissing in front of our victim. We kinda do tis for fun (sometimes money ;D .Theres just this one incident the forced us brother to have a incest (weve never done it before . There was a guy (hes a richy UPD alumni  who offered us something in exchange for sex . Then he sudenly changed his mind. He want us to have a live show.. (like wut??  So we didnt have choice but to lick and suck each others dick and swallow each other cum.. (it was a yuck ..

Kaya pala di na kita nakita sa Rodics these past few days. Handa na sana ako magpakilala. But I dont think this is the right time. I hope you are doing well. I want to tell you that things are gonna be okay, but I know nothing I say can make you feel better. Stay strong. My heart goes out to you and your family.I read the comments written at my previous confession. Natawa lang ako na merong nagcomment at nagtry magpanggap na ako. I would NEVER comment at my own confession, no matter what. I would rather keep myself anonymous, and I am sure Stephie remembers what I look like (Sorry dude, but our common friend told me that Steph remember my face a bit.

That time, I left her a bundle of white roses and a note, written by yours truly in the dormitory where she stayedDear Mayee,I know you are wondering why I am doing this, aside from the fact that its Valentines Day. It has been a long time years since I met you few years ago and during those times seeing each other or not, I have this strange feeling when Im with you or thinking about you that I couldnt understand sometimes. Though youre with somebody else (too bad for me, but Im still happy for you , I didnt quit this so-called foolishness of mine. Dont worry, this will surely be the last thing that I am going to do for you, I think. Besides, we wont be seeing each other for a very long time. Please dont get mad at me after reading this. I just wanted to do something extraordinary to an extraordinary person like you in this extraordinary holiday. I am in love with you. I love you. And I will miss you so much.P.S. By the way, please keep it secret.- Hagibis, SLIS

#crushconfeHi cuteandnerdygirl,We met in a foreign language class about a year ago. You caught my attention the first time I saw you. You were somehow unique compared to the other girls I knew- you had a different sense of fashion, you were a bit nerdy (one who definitely loves to read books a lot , you were also a bit childish. But those were the very things that made me like you. I dont know why, but I guess youre my type.We dont speak to each other a lot in class even if was sited near you. I guess were both shy persons. We only had the chance during class activities and oral presentations. We also see each other on campus but the only words that we say are HIs and HELLOs. But seeing you is enough to brighten up my day.After that semester, we didnt see each other again. All of your classes were at CAL and AS and Im at the opposite end of the campus. Up until this semester, I saw you along AS Walk and I noticed that you have blossomed. You became an attractive young woman. My heart just melted. And so I wrote this confession. You probably wouldnt remember me, but thats OK. I just want to tell you that youre beautiful and I still like you, J******.

#crushconfeTheres this girl na laging kumakain sa Rodics as long as I can remember. Its either she dines there or buys something for take-out. Shes always in the company of her three male friends whenever I see her around UP, halatang mga rich kids. Then mga Chinese ata sila? Pero this girl, even as my sources say that her family owns a supermarket chain, is so simple, and very friendly, even to the staff of the diner, the janitors and the security guards around school. (Halatang stalker. Shes damn smart, too. Her smile is so contagious, her laugh is like a sweet melody. Her friends refer to her as Stephie. She has this signature mannerism of tucking her stat locks of hair behind her ear. Days turned into weeks, then to months, then the semester ended... And a new one just begun... And here I am, araw-araw parin pumupunta sa shopping center para lang makita siya. Then just today, as I was rushing in towards Rodics, I bumped into her sa doorway ng diner. Parang boom! The both of us in a collision. She dropped all the notes and books she was carrying, with me in a complete state of shock. P*cha, yung feeling na aatakihin ka sa puso dahil napakalakas ng heartbeat mo!  I helped pick up her books and stared shamelessly at her name, written neatly in the way that only girls can do. I then began reciting my apologies, in what seems to be longer than a litany, while silently praying to all them Chinese gods that this Chinese girl wont freak out. She just turned to me, her eyes to my eyes, with all the sincerity there is left in this chaotic world, Its ok. No harm done. She then flashed me her sweet smile, sabay, Ingat! And then she was gone. Damn, parang maiihi ako sa tuwa at kilig!!!Someday, I hope I would have the courage to talk to you, and ask you out, kahit tapsi lang sa Rodics.- RODICulous Lover,2011, CBA
#crushconfeTo The Diliman Files and Bon Bolagao,Maraming maraming maraming salamat, dahil sa page na ito nalaman ko pangalan ni Bon Bolagao. Matagal ko na sya gusto i-stalk. Nung una ko palang siyang nakita crush ko na sya, tapos halos araw araw last sem ko sya nakikita sa UP KAS tambayan sa tapat ng CASAA *Yung org tambayan namin, katabi ng UP KAS* So ayun nga, alam ko lang ang first name nya ay Bon dahil yun ang naririnig ko sa mga kasama nyang tumambay. Sobrang hot nya tingnan at ang lakas ng dating niya. Madalas nga napagkwekwentuhan pa namin sya ng mga ka close kong orgmates and pare pareho kaming nagsasabi na muka talaga syang masarap at magaling sa kama.Sana nag UP KAS member din ako, kasi nakikita ko na halos lahat ng girls doon ay nayayakap ka at nabebeso ka pa araw araw. Pero tama nga yung unang nagpost tungkol sayo, jerk ka, kasi may one time na may nagpunta na babae sa UP KAS para puntahan ka, tapos ikaw di mo pinansin kaya yung brod mo nalang yung kinausap nya. Naawa ako dun kay girl, pero natuwa din ako kasi minus 1 na ang karibal ko >  hahaha. May one time pa na parang nagpapatugtog kayo ng mga sexy songs, tapos nagsayaw ka ng sexy, shit sobrang hot nun, at dahil sayo nagpunta ako sa girls cr nung time na yun. Sana maging kaibigan kita, and maging friends with benefits tayo, kasi balita ko mahilig ka sa mga no strings attached. Hay, eto ako patuloy pa ding nangangarap...Hulaan nyo nalang kung anung katabing org ng UP KAS ako  - UPKASsana,2010, CSSP

#crushconfessionSince people have been dropping names anyway Im gonna do the same. This is for KEI GARCIA from the college of LAW. I remember when you went to our large class to rtr. I think you are super smart and confident and sobrang lakas ng dating. Im writing this confession kasi I saw you again last friday lining up to pay for tuition and my big crush on you came back and I was so kilig just seeing you so near. Wala lang. I dont care if you are single or taken. I just want one date with you. I wanna pick apart your brains. Then make out. Or more? -biCuriousGirly, 2011-*****, CBA

#gustomakatryNBSB ako pero I admit na na-inlove na rin naman ako. Ako yung type ng girl na hindi pagboboyfriend ang inaatupag noong high school at puro friends and studies and focus. But now, I really want to have a relationship for the sake na magkaroon ng experience (only on a romantic way and not a sexual one  pero walang nagkakagusto sakin dahil na rin siguro konti lang ang friends ko dahil hindi ako mahilig kumausap ng mga tao and Im not a girl-next-door type of person. And since na-open sakin ang mga same sex relationship dahil laganap naman siya sa campus, I actually want to try one also. Gusto ko lang maexperience yung mga nararanasan ng iba kasi I feel like sobrang boring ng life ko. (-TRIAL101,2013, Engg
#lolzonedPara kay Arcade Sona,Hallo there. Kamusta? Ang laki na ng inimprove mo sa League of Legends. Naaalala ko pa yung mga unang beses pa lang kitang nakikitang maglaro. Nakakatuwa, kasi kababae mong tao, Garen at Darius pa yung mga nakahiligan mo, mga lalaking tanky champions. Yeah, we can say na-Noxian Guillotine mo ang puso ko in an instant. <3Ayun, sa ngayon, nakikita kong isa ka nang dedicated Support. How sweet it is to be supported by you. Ako, di ko primary role ang AD carry, pero basta ikaw kasama ko sa Bot lane, Ill carry you any time of the day. And I did, ilang beses na rin diba? Ang galing ko kaya. At ang galing mong mag-alaga. We make a good duo. ; Naging inspirasyon kita to push my skills to the limit. Pang-impress na rin. Yan, ngayong tapos na ang season, dinededicate ko yung Diamond Tier ko sayo. Congrats din sa Gold mo!Sayang, gusto sana kitang maging Support ng buhay ko. Sadly, may iba ka nang AD carry na kasama. Oh well.Wishing you all the best.-Armsmaster Jax, 201*, Engg
#lovesexanddrugs #notreallygoodatgrammarsorryYear 2007, we started dating. Countless shits. Endless problems. Shameful experiences. Desperate situations. We all had these bombarding us in every waking moment of our fragile lives, yet, I can proudly say we managed to beat the odds. Fast forward to 6 years after and sadly we broke up.In a nutshell, I guess its not even the environment that keeps on breaking us is the problem, but our differences and personal baggage that transcended the love we had for each other. Needless to say, it had to stop.Its almost six months after the breakup and I can say that it was okay for the both of us, right? Last week, I had a couple of drinks with my friends and a plan to smoke weed later on. Remember when we were together we were that couple so uptight at each other that comfort zone was the only zone to go? I really dont know what came to my mind but I invited you to come with us and surprisingly you said yes.Because of work stuff you arrived at three in the morning, so all my friends went home already. We decided to do it in your place. Without further ado, we got high after just about right amount of it. God! We were laughing so hard that time. I even remember you laughing so hard cause to you I looked like a monster and then youd act scared in the cutest way possible then laughed and laughed and laughed like a baby being tickled.The best part was the music! For Petes sake I cannot live without music and you are probably the most unenthusiastic person about music that I know, but holy shit you had Bob Marley playing in the background (What else changed huh? . Anyway, In our six years together, I do not reckon us having a chance to dance, so at that very moment I told you Uy sayaw naman tayo.It was some pseudo magical venture into the altered state but I can still feel right now all the electricity I felt when we stood up, your arms around my neck, and mine on your waist with both our heads leaning into each others shoulder. For the past six months, we both acted like cool kids that perfectly handled this breakup, like everything was back to normalcy. But then who wouldve thought that some organic shit our society usually frowns upon could free us from all the lies we cover ourselves with. I still remember the line from that song, Emancipate yourself from mental slavery. And from this line while we were standing there, it came. Tears started flowing on my cheeks. I never cried so hard in my life. It was the purest of cries that Ive ever felt as well. I looked at you and to my surprise tears were also watering your face. It was a good fifteen-minute crying session while we keep wiping each others face from tears that seems boundless that time.After the tear-jerking moment, I suddenly felt like kissing you. I did, you kissed back. I cannot explain in words what went after. All I can say is that when you were high, all your senses and emotions were heightened. Just imagine all the touches, the kisses, the everything. Oh, do I need to state the obvious? Well, we had sex. Some mind-boggling, weed-driven, profound sex. And its probably the best we ever had, at least for me (#hugot .When we settled down, you asked me what it meant for me (those tears we shed together . And with conviction, even I was so high at that moment I told you that it was tears of acceptance, tears of letting go, and I also said that yes I was hurt, but those tears were some sort of release for me. It was mutual for you, you said it yourself.To all the bored readers of The Diliman Files I know you are probably wondering what the hell is my confession anyway. Well, you are one privileged motherfucker cause you get to know that despite all the pure emotions that succumbed us that night, I chose to be rational when I fucking lied to her.I know youre not bothering yourself with any UP shiz like The Diliman Files because to you, UP was just was an accesory to your goals. But just in case, I want you to know that those tears were tears of regret and that, Mahal na mahal na mahal pa rin kita beh!- Redemption Song,2009, NCPAG
#m2mIt was a cold and quiet night in Malate. You knocked on the door. You said the words I ardently wished to believe and hear so badly at the time.I donﾒt know what came over my soul, what subdued the voice of reason, what unleashed the libidinous beast within, but soon after, I invited you inside. We somehow wound up lying next to each other in my bedroom. The air was pregnant with tension, our breathing labored, our hands clenched tight.We fought to keep the conversation on small talk, inconsequential things real couples would talk about and feel just fine. But we were not a real couple. You were my paramour. I was your target.You tried to play the noble guy until the last minute --- wanting to turn back, but not ready to leave. You tried to talk me out of it but none of us would budge.But the moment my lips brushed against yours, the fight was over, all barriers (and clothes  were gone.Fingers became frantic, moans louder and kisses more torrid by the second, our mouths voracious yet swift yet skillful over our shared, throbbing manhood.You then lathered the lube, slipped the condom on and slipped inside me with such ease. Each of your passionate thrusts and heated utterances seared themselves into my memory and lit my soul ablaze. Our bodies could not keep still. The fire of our lust could only grow brighter. We thrashed, caressed, squeezed and kissed to the sound of escalating, impatient groans until we could do so no more. Despite the fact that we were not each otherﾒs firsts, never before have I felt so deliciously and completely bound to someone. I never knew something so morally wrong could feel so physically right. We enjoyed the afterglow and held each other until the ruddy glow of daybreak.To this sweet talker and Renegade Juggernaut, come out of the closet, if you will.Thank you for giving me one of the most memorable nights (and body-wracking orgasms  I ever had.You were my best loverﾅbut only so between the sheets. Itﾒs a pity I canﾒt say the same outside of the bedroom. Sana masaya ka na ngayon sa UP Diliman.PS. Use protection like we did and just let go of your homophobic bigotry and feigned-disgust. Come out!It may seem to be such a hassle and a chore, but it saves you and others from lots of trouble and pain.-Renegade Juggernaut,2010, Social Work & Community Development

#nalilitoakoBest friend ko si Jake since high school. As in super close kami. Parehas kaming mahilig sa math at kami lagi ang representatives ng school namin kapag may math contests. Perehas kaming pumasa ng UPCAT at parehas pa ng course. Payat at may-okay-lang-na-mukha siya nung high school. Pero ewan ko ba nung second year na kami, bigla na lang siyang gumwapo at nagkaroon ng matipunong katawan. Ewan ko kung anong ginawa niya, di naman siya nag-gygym. Hindi ko alam kung kelan nagsimula, basta bigla na lang parang nahuhulog na pala ako sa best friend ko. Tapos one time, nagshare siya sakin tungkol sa super crush niya. Aray!!! Bakit ganito ka-sakit? Ngumiti pa rin ako at kunyari inaasar siya. Pero tang*na ang sakit! Almost one year ko ring tiniis to. Pinilit kong ibaling ang atensyon ko sa ibang lalaki. Kung sinu-sino na lang nagiging crush ko, pati yung cute na prof ko sa physics 73. Until one time, nalaman kong crush pala ako ng isa sa mga crushes ko. Eh di, grinab ko na ang pagkakataon. To make the story short, naging kami ni crush, si Greg. At first, ang motibo ko lang ay para mawala yung sakit. Masaya si Jake para sa amin ni Greg. Naging friends na rin sila ni Greg. Mahal ko rin naman si Greg. Oo, mahal ko talaga siya. Mag-iisang taon na rin kami. Kaya lang.... kaya lang.... Recently, nagshare ulit sakin si Jake. Two weeks na pala siyang may nililigawan. At common friend namin yung girl. Bakit nasasaktan ulit ako? Bakit ayokong magkaroon siya ng girlfriend? Ang selfish ko naman! (( Gusto ko namang maging masaya si best friend, pero bakit natatakot akong magkaroon siya ng gf? At pano si Greg? Hindi niya alam yung secret ko tungkol sa best friend ko. Mahal ko naman siya,... but why??? (- hanggangbestfriendlang, 20xx, Engg

#profcrushHi Prof. Peleo IV I have always liked older guys. I like your arms and your chest and I find you extremely hot. Your Ph.D is another plus. Pardon me for being lewd but the thoughts of you make me jerk off everytime after your class.- DILFboy,2010, TMC
#profcrushI dont know if my being a daddys girl has anything to do with this, but I have always been attracted to older guys.So it was no surprise when I began to harbor a crush for my prof. At first, I was apprehensive that I got him instead of the other prof who was handling the other class at that time. He was relatively new, I think, having come from some foreign university. (Though he got his undergrad degree here in Diliman. Well, aside from being a comely old dude, he was also super intellectual! The way he explained concepts, the way he explained cases, and how we could really make a difference in the world with all his out-of-the-box thinking...its enough to make me wet. I really enjoyed listening to him, especially with his accent! What I really want to say is, ever since he became my prof, hes become the center of my sexual fantasies. Every time I get bored in class, I would just think of him and Id immediately get aroused. I would masturbate to the fantasy of me and him doing it after class hours, with his broad chest and strong, hairy arms pinning me to the table. Those big, meaty hands caressing and undressing me. And those same hands and British tongue fondling my lady parts.So to you, if and whenever you see me, youll know why I always have a big smile on my face. >; - PayleontologisT, CSSP

Im 18 and still, NBSB. Yung family ko laging pinapamukha na hindi daw ako approachable thats why wala akong suitors. My best friend never stops to bash and rub the fact on my face na Ive never had a boyfriend nor a suitor... EVER. Feeling ko kasi wala talaga akong kalandi-landi. Seryoso, I really think na kailangan na talagang extra effort ang paglalandi sa panahong ito.  I dont even have an ounce of landi. Im not as shy as you might think. My friends always invite me to night outs because they think that Im the life of the party. I know that Im a really funny person (yes, self-proclaimed, bitches . Wala akong baon pero mahirit (hindi maharot ah  akong tao. Well, naisip ko rin siguro na ako yung tipong friendzoned type of girl. Huhuhu. At kung bigla niyong isiping theory ay pangit ako, hindi naman (ata . Im not saying Im pretty pero lately, each time I meet with my friends and relatives, they always say that puberty hit me so well. Naging high-definition daw ang features ko. Most of them think that I have a boyfriend and all that. I feel flattered, by the way. But the truth is WALA TALAGA!

Napapansin ko rin na madalas napapangiti rin mga kasama mo pag nandyan ka.I thought you were just a pretty face until some of my friends started talking about you. Maraming nagsasabi na sobrang friendly mo raw. Popular ka nga sa mga PolSci students na kilala ko eh. The best part is, di mo daw alam. Ang humble mo, sabi nila. Marami kang achievements pero di mo sinasabi. Yung mga nagsabi samin ay yung mga kilala ka nung highschool pa.Debater ka raw. Singer. Artist. Honor Student. Public Speaker. etc etcAng galing niyo po talaga.Im not sure if I have a crush on you. But I know for a fact na na-aamaze ako sayo.I just want you to know that nakakainspire ka.

(Sorry for this, readers of The Diliman Files. I know there has been a lot of love confessions here but I just couldnﾒt resist this opportunity to tell this guy how much I admire him. Iﾒll keep this short, donﾒt worry, ha!  To ﾓSteveﾔ from AIT, You immediately caught my attention when I first saw you in one of my GE classes during my first year. You were this guy who asked me if he was in the right Comm 3 section and who seated behind me. We became jeep buddies instantly, and every after class, we would wait for a Toki jeep to take us to our next classes. We shared stories typical guy friends would talk about like games, subjects, girls etc.  Two sems later, we stumbled upon each other again, now in a PE class. We enjoyed every part of that PE class, since we were on different teams and we both were really competitive. Although I win most of the challenges, nothing stopped us from being cool with each other. Long story short, we became closer, closer to the point that I would accompany you to the waiting shed and sort of send you good luck for your next class.  Yes, I was falling for you that time. Believe me, I did not expect it too. I know that I have been confused with myself for a long time, but that was really the first time I really had that crazy feeling for a guy.  At the last day of our PE class, I took the opportunity to accompany you to your college. Imagine, we walked from SC to AIT! And because of that, since you were wearing slippers that time, you wounded yourself when you lost your balance on the sidewalk. Iﾒll spare the readers with the gory details, pero sobrang frustrated mo that time kasi magrereport ka pa for your next class. And thatﾒs when the magic happened, when we were crossing the bridge over commonwealth, I really wanted to hold your hand and enjoy the moment. Aalalayan sana kita because you were injured. Pero sabi ko, ﾑwag na lang. Sharing the same umbrella under the hot sun would be enough for me. And then after that, we chatted sa Facebook. I asked your opinions on certain things like drugs, contraception, progressive organizations and of course, same-sex relationship. That was when I learned that we would never have a thing, kasi, you are a conservative Christian. And you donﾒt believe in an ﾓadam and steveﾔ relationship.  But I never lost hope. God teaches us to love one another, so why canﾒt I love you, right? I am not asking for you to love me back or what. I just want you to know that I really like you and no religion canﾒt stop me for doing so.  I know I shouldﾒve told you this personally, pero huwag na. I just want you to know that there is someone here who likes you for whoever, whatever you are. I will always be here, Iﾒm just a text away. And I hope we see each other again sa ibang classes.

1st year, 1st sem, 2009. Apps orye nga inaaplayan naming org nung makilala ko sya. Sobrang tandang-tanda ko un kasi patapos na ung orye nung dumating sya. Tinawanan ko pa sya nun kasi feeling ko ang aga nya...para bukas. Char!E di ko naman akalaing magiging close kami. As in super close, tipong sakin sya hahanapin ng mga orgmates ko (oo pumasa kami sa app process .In the process, nagkagusto ako sa kanya.Kaso pinanghinaan ako ng loob nun kasi feeling ko nun di naman nya ako bet. So I just pretended na wala lang kahit deep inside kinikilig na ko nang very very hard pag kasama ko sya.Tapos, November that same year, biglang nag-iba ihip ng hangin! Sinasabayan na ko sa Katip jeep kahit pa-Philcoa daan nya, sasabayan din nya ko maglakad to my next class kahit tirik na tirik ang araw. Mga ganung damoves.Si koya pala, nagkakagusto na rin!So to make the long story short, naging kami. At four years na kami ngayong December.This post is not a sex or crush or heartbreak confession. Gusto ko lang i-share ung kwento naming dalawa, to tell the world na may mga success love stories din sa UP.  At kay Babe, thank you sa lahat. You are my best friend, my brother, lahat na! Sobrang thankful ako at sumama ka sa nakakalokang byahe ng buhay ko. Kapit lang, next June nasa UP na ulit ako. I love you!    - Charaughtera,2009, MassComm

I know, because I was watching you, too.At first I thought I was imagining it, but catching your eye three times might be more than coincidental. Either way, I just want to say you inspired me to write a poem.  Id like to get to know you better, as a friend. Heres to hoping that you get to read this, and comment on it. Ill comment as well.

7/5/2014 235205Nang dahil sa isang nabasa kong post dito na nag make love sila sa kotse sa may NIGS, bigla nagbago ang pananaw ko sa buhay. Lalaki ako, and I look forward to girls around the campus. But the fact that ang pinapanood ko pa rin since naging bukas ang isip ko sa buhay ay gay porn at wala nang iba, sexually attracted ako sa same sex for all these years. Pero dahil sa post na yum, I started to watch straight porn and I find it better than before. Unti unti na natuturn ang attention ko sa babae which I think is a better path for me.Though I respect the girls around so no touch till I finish college. Ill keep my virginity pure for that someone.

8/11/2014 001001UP Bonfire- Rants of a varsityWhenever you hear the UP Menﾒs basketball team being mentioned around the UAAP scene it usually ends with the phrases ﾓﾅloses by..ﾔ or ﾓgets beaten byﾔ and with all due respect to out  to UP nating mahal our team isnﾒt the best around the collegiate level.Time and time again weﾒve witnessed the many disappointing moments our Fighting Maroons basketball team experience game after game. Who could forget the blow out performance of the UE Red Warriors during the opening game of the Season 77 where we lost 87-59. As I watching in the crowds cheering for our team I could only notice how heart broken people were when the game ended and to see the disappointment in the eyes the MBT (menﾒs basketball team . And what I admire about the entire UP community is that, no matter what happens in victory or in defeat we still support them and tell them to keep fighting and go one and get back to the golden days of Maroon basketball! We tell them that weﾒre proud of them no matter what the outcome is.But on August 9 we witnessed the entire country go into a frenzy when social media accounts from Twitter and Facebook heard that UP finally.. wait for itﾅ WON A GAME! At long last, after being winless for two years the UP MBT bagged that much awaited win- and what became the highlight of this event was the bonfire that happened in the Sunken Garden a few hours after the game. If you were there you could see students, professors, alumni, and the rest of the UP faithful witness a celebration over the end of a winless drought- whether they saw it as farce or sincerely celebrated is not in my call anymore. But needless to say there were a lot of people.But whatﾒs the big deal actually?But with the all the celebrations out there a lot of athletes from different sports were really dismayed that they never get the recognition they deserve after a championship or a podium finish after long months of hard work and sacrifices just to meet with the requirements academically and still have the energy to compete at the top form during competitions. And if youﾒre not aware of the over-all standing of UP in the UAAP, we are ranked third, only below DLSU and UST.  Which only says that the other teams in UP are really grinding their guts out.Personally Iﾒm in one of those teams who ended Season 76 in the podium and won a few events myself. And what pains most of the other athletes is that we never get any recognition from the community. The truth is Iﾒm very happy for the UP MBT for their win! Probably I could compare the reaction of the UP community to the father in parable of the Prodigal Son. Seeing his son finally being reborn the father celebrates with all his workers while the older brother while doing the right thing all through out his life never even received a small sheep for him and his friends.From all the rants of the athletes from other varsities, we are just screaming for one thingﾅ SUPPORT US TOO!ﾗwhen we lose we want the community we are a part of comfort us, we want to be encouraged and see who are the people we are going to give our hearts out for during competitions. Or even at least at the season we could see people appreciate what we did for our alma mater. From what Iﾒve experienced what pulls me down at times is when weﾒve achieved something and it seems like no one even noticed your efforts, imagine itﾒs like the feeling when nobody knows itﾒs you birthday not even your friends. Well I hope what we are asking for is not too much. We could do without having a superstar team manager or being hyped up by the media all we want is the communityﾒs support and appreciation. Hope itﾒs not too much!-Maroons-5,2011, Mass Communication

Tour guide siya sa team na napuntahan ko tapos siya yung unang kumausap sa akin. Gagawin ko nang OA at sasabihin na nalove at first sight ako. Sobrang cute at bubbly niya. Ang hyper at friendly. Maganda rin at medyo matangkad. Comfortable akong kausap siya at naging masaya yung tour. Kaso naheartbroken ako nung nakita kong may kaclose siyang lalaki.

8/2/2014 192546So nagsimula na ang The Great Freshie Tour tapos nakita ko siya, a cute guy na naka glasses at naka white shirt. Sa buong tour sa UP Diliman lagi ko siyang nakakasalubong kahit sobrang dami ng tao. Lagi pa kaming nagkaka awkward eye contact, parang ikaw nanaman? or I think we ZINGED just like in Hotel Transylvania. Hahaha! I was surprised na I found him as my type kasi yung mga gusto ko ay yung tipong matatangkad at musician and I really have to know a guy to determine if I like him or not. I dont even know his name and I didnt have the guts to ask or even smile back. May itsura naman ako pero sadyang hiyain lang talaga ako pag dating sa mga lalaki.Nung patapos na yung Freshie Tour di ko na siya makita, yes hinanap ko siya. Wala parin. Nung papunta na ako sa sakayan ng jeep papuntang Katipunan nandun siya nag-aantay din. Dumaan ako tapos pag lingon ko nakatingin siya sakin, for one last time. Sana makita ko ulit siya.  -Zinger,2014, Not Disclosed

After reading Norwegian Wood, I further reinforced my belief that it is possible for a person to love two people at the same time. To wit, Haruki Murakami said, things like that happen all the time in this great big world of ours. Its like taking a boat out on a beautiful lake on a beautiful day and thinking both the sky and the lake are beautiful.Having said that though, I do not tolerate cheating. Im just recognizing the fact that we do not stop being attracted to other people despite the fact that we are already committed to someone. Its just that we do not have to act upon every single moment of attraction we have with others. We already made a choice; we ought to stand by it.I wish more people knew this.

Ako yung tipo ng tao na sinasabi nilang madali lang magsabi ng I love you. Abutan mo ako ng kung anong pinapaabot ko, may kasamang I love you ang thank you ko. Pag may namimiss na ako, ititweet o itetext ko sila na may kasamang I love you. Pag may favor na ginawa para sa akin, maliit man yan o malaki, garantisadong may I love you yan.Ganun ako eh. Affectionate. Kung titingnan natin, sa mundo ngayon, parang ang daling magalit, mainis, malungkot. Pero bahagi ang pagsabi ng I love you sa defense mechanism ko laban sa negativity ng mundo. Di ba? Mas madaling maghanap ng dahilan kung bakit karapat-dapat mahalin ang tao, romantic man o hindi.Pero sana, mahanap ko na rin yung lalaking masasabihan ko ng tunay na I love you. (Babae po ako hehe.

Among all the men Ive slept with in UP, I would say that the best ones are from Law. Theyre quite older than the rest of us which means that theyre more mature and in control. Also, they have kinda walked the dog around the park na so they know what theyre doing. Ika nga, if orgasm hanap mo siguradong maidedeliver sayo. Although its only going to be an investment-less relationship eh. Its not that theyre not really into me. Its just that siguro I came into their lives at the wrong time. What can I do diba, mahirap talaga ang law. Well at least Ive helped the guys loosen up a little. Its just so cute that after every mind blowing sex, they all did the same thing - look at my pretty face, run their fingers through my hair, kiss me deeply then go back to their books or iPad or cases. Then I go through the next day, hang over from another chemistry filled loveless night, waiting for some law guy to text me, Can I ask you out again? Well thats just me.- JustSomeGirl, CAL

August 26Naglalakad kami ng mga orgmates ko sa may papuntang Technohub around 6-7PM tapos may nakasalubong kaming dalawang lalaki. Yung isa nasa katamtaman ang tangkad, tapos medyo malaman. Nakajacket sya at backpack. Yung isa naman mas matangkad sa kanya. Nakasalamin. Parang chinito. Magkaholding hands sila habang naglalakad.Sa totoo lang, hindi ko agad napansin na magkaholding hands sila kasi parang normal lang naman silang naglalakad. Lalaking lalaki rin silang tingnan. Nang mapansin kong magkaholding hands sila, dun ko rin napansing masaya sila. Tahimik na masaya. Nakakainggit. Nakakatuwa. Bilib ako sa kanila. Sana mas madami pang tulad nila na kayang panindigan ang pagmamahalan nila sa harap ng ibang tao. Ako nga hindi ko maamin sa crush ko na gusto ko sya e.Anyway, ayun lang.

Bea LejanoI am consciously, madly, and deeply in love with you. When we first met, I had no inkling of what was about to happen. I never thought that I will like you this much. Honestly, I had no idea how it all began. Am I captivated by your beauty? Or is it your personality, though I never got a chance to know you better? But I just woke up one morning and realize that I am falling in love with you. Thats when I became aware of all these strange feelings that I feel whenever youre around. My heart beats fast and slow, at the same time, whenever I see you or just think of you. There are times when I felt like something is about to explode in my chest. And when youre near me, I cant move a single muscle-- I cant write, talk, or walk. Your presence had never failed to paralyze me. Your smile, though rarely seen, had made me hold my breath. Your voice and laugh can make my world stop. There are numerous feelings you made me experience. Feelings that are so magical, I found it hard to turn them into words.But is there a possibility that you like me too? Or am I just imagining things? The way you look into my eyes like its just the two of us; days when you sat next to me instead of taking those available seats that were more convenient for you; times when we always end up as partners-- were they ordinary events that I desperately turned into a vision that you like me as well?PS.

I know lots of stuff there are just imitations but WHO CARES?!No ones gonna ask you naman whether what youre wearing is authentic or not. One thing I didnt like about the place though was that it was pretty crowded.Siguro kung sa Forever21 or Uniqlo ako namili, ilang piraso lang nabili ko pero iba sa Divi talaga.That was a very nice experience for me. <3 Shopa-holic 2011 Business Administration

My then-girlfriend and I would even be able to get off in the dark places Multi-purpose hall, fire exit, the garden.One weekend afternoon during the second semester, kung kailan konting residente lang ang natitira sa dorm, my girlfriend and I got extra frisky and decided to get some action done on that stairway at the Girls Annex area leading to the mess hall...Walang ibang tao.We were making out in broad daylight. Got to a point where my hands were able to unhook her bra to play with her two amazing dalagita breasts. I was hard. She was wet. It was perfect.All of a sudden there was applause and we heard loud cheers Go, freshies! Go! We were dumbstruck and did not know what to do. The applause came from a room in Yakal, the neighboring dorm; our upperclass kuyas and ates were watching us all along.

Pero sigurado naman akong masaya ako kasama, in a different way nga lang yung sense of humor ko. Masasabi ko namang matured na ako at responsable sa ibang bagay.Naalala ko yung last MU ko, binigay ko naman lahat ng makakaya ko. Pero hanggang MU lang talaga abot ko. Di kinaya e. Hindi rin niya nabalik yung pagmamahal na binuhos ko. Di ako minahal e.Masakit yung nabigo kang i-prove kung gaano mo siya kamahal. Pero may mas masakit pa. Yun yung hindi ka man lang binigyan ng chance na i-prove yung pagmamahal mo sa kanya. Na nangyari ngayon sa akin. Grabe lang. Haha.Ganun ba kapag good guy? Kapag average lang? Di kagwapuhan pero di rin naman panget, average lang, tapos di malaki ang katawan, etc. Assets? Siguro medyo matalino(ok ang grades ko nung 1st sem, naks , medyo masaya kasama, matured, marunong tumugtog ng gitara. Pero wala rin e, wala pa ngang nagmamahal sa akin e. Haha. Siguro ang maipagmamalaki ko lang talaga ay yung wala akong intensyon na manloko at mamahalin ko siya(kung sino ka man  higit sa sarili ko.Ayun. Hinahanap ko pa rin yung babaeng mas tinitingnan muna kung matino yung lalaki bago yung physical characteristics. Di ko sinasabing lahat ng babae kagwapuhan muna ang tinitingnan, madalas lang na ganun. Di ko nilalahat. Average guy man ako, mamahalin naman kita nang todo. <3 - Good Guy, 201*, Statistics

Dahil meron ng kumakain ng bato, papel, shreds ng eraser, pulbo at booger. Mag coconfess na rin ako sa ginagawa ko nung bata pa ako.I like coins. Yeap, I eat coins. Ang pinaka paboritong kung kainin ay ang 5 cent coin kasi may butas ito. Kumakain rin ako ng 25 cent. Pati singko kinakain ko na.Nakakain na rin ako ng bracelet pero mas gusto ko pa rin ang coins.

Dear CW Girl,You dont know me, but weve met before. Ive been following your blog ever since. You were from St. Paul before but you transferred to Diliman after a year. I knew you will be at the Faculty Center during the enrollment period (because you stated it in your blog  so I roam around DECL and I found you there. I took up an Eng 12 class so I could see you at CAL twice a week. I was hoping we could find a class together but Im already in my fourth year taking up my major subject, but having an extra GE was worth it - the next subject in our Eng 12 class is your class. I could see you every meeting! I even watch you perform at some event  in CAL.I dont care if you have a boyfriend. Ill be forever stalking you.By the way, Im happy that youre into blogging again.-Stalker Dude, 2006-XXXXX, Engg
Dear ChenaPotpotIm calling you ChenaPotpot because thats your username in our PE class. I also know youre from CHE, and had internship form SumoSam. And you told me that one of the fruits near our PE classroom is edible.Nakakapagod ang Band and Ball (Hi Sir Manila!  but you inspired me to push through with it. Youre super cute. Youre physically attractive, and you err... do dance with the music in a way I admit it turned me on. I try not to think of you in any other way, especially when were sweaty na in class, I just want to know you better and be a friend, perhaps develop from there.But we didnt. Torpe man here. I dont know where you are right now, but I swear I wasnt (intentionally  looking at your curves during PE. Im just curious. Kamusta ka na?- Seth, MassComm
Dear Christian,We never really had that decent talk on how to end things.  Not even a phone call. Just a lousy exchange of emails and text messages.  Clearly, up until the very crucial moments, we never truly made an effort to make this thing work.Looking back, Diliman housed the blossom our friendship and romance. The trees in the sunken garden witnessed the times when we first sneaked our kisses.  Dorm mess halls and common areas used to be our movie house ﾖ with just a laptop and a few series episodes. We used to walk hand in hand as we enjoy our long walks around the acad oval.  We always looked forward singing along to our favorite bands in the UP Fair.  I remembered you even tried to get me a big teddy bear by winning one of those shooting games in the fair but ended up getting a small banana-shaped Sponge Bob plush instead.All my memories of UP are moments shared with you. For a long time, I thought it would be the great story to tell our grandkids when they become Iskos and Iskas themselves.But then, reality fucked us over. After I graduated, I was able to land a job overseas and you still had yet to complete your engineering degree. With sucky schedules and different priorities, we were not able to make time for each other. Distance was that big change we never managed to survive.If you can read this right now, Iﾒm sorry for being so weak that I gave up on us so easily.  Although we are both happy now with our own relationships, I just wanted you to know that youﾒll always have that special place in my heart and I hope someday youﾒll find a space in yours to forgive me. Thank you for making my years in UP unforgettable.- Jade,2008, Tourism

Dear Future Wife,I cant exactly remember the first time we met but its probably one of the gatherings of our org. Youre one of the cutest and prettiest girl Ive known. We became close at the time when I was already on my last year as a student. I knew from then on that I like you, problem was that you already had a boyfriend for 2 years. Ouch. So there, cant make damoves but I still value our times together with our other orgmates. Theres this smile inside me whenever I see you.I graduated on 2011 and I regret that I havent had the chance to tell how much I like you but its okay since I knew you were happy with your BF. I came to visit in the general GA one time and thankfully, you were there. We had taken a picture together that I will forever treasure.   I knew we will make a good couple, but then you were still with your BF. Ouch again.Fast forward to 2013, I learned that you broke up with your BF. Big smile lol. But I still havent told you I like you not only to be my GF but to be my wife. Apparently, no one else know about this except God.I sent you a text message on your graduation to say my congratulations and I learned that you were leaving the next few days as you were going to have Med School somewhere in the South. I asked if we can still meet and you said yes. Apparently, I was busy with my work that I havent met you before you left. I really felt sad about that since I know I wont see you for a long time. Anyway, you had your birthday last month and sent you a greeting. I even posted on your wall just to make sure you know I remembered your birthday.  I know it will still be a long journey for you to finish Med School, but I will be here waiting. Maybe you still dont know I like you, but God is preparing both of us for our future. Youre always prayed for, My Future Wife.Nagmamahal,Your Future Husband-Future Husband, 2007-3*5*5
Dear Greven Carl Manuel,Kaklase kita nung 2nd Sem AY12-13. Freshie ka pa ata nung time na yun. Classmates tayo sa isang GE. Sobrang crush na crush kita noon kasi sobrang nice mo tapos ang hilig mong magkwento ng mga interesting na bagay. Ang dami mong alam sa science nakakafascinate. Tapos parang may sweet guy aura ka pa kaya sobra talagang nakakakilig pag magkasama tayo minsan. Sobrang </3 ang nafeel ko nung nakita kitang may ka-date ka ata sa CASAA one afternoon.Ang sweet sweet niyo tignan. Ang ganda ni ateng ka-date mo tapos parang ang ganda ganda ng chemistry niyo. Nakakainsecure at nakakainggit kasi si ate yung nakakaramdam ng mga feelings na gusto ko maramdaman galing sayo. Greven, kung kayo pa rin ni ateng maganda, maging mabuti ka sanang boyfriend sa kanya. And kay ateng maganda naman, sana wag mong i-take advantage ang feelings ni Greven para sayo, kasi nandito ako, wishing na sana ako na lang ang babaeng minahal niya at masasaktan ako kung yung tanging bagay na inaasam asam ko ay ibabaliwala mo lang.- WriteMo,2012, CSSP
Dear Isko, Iska, Iskong-Iska, and Iskang-Isko,Heres a friendly advice. It may not be as obvious; it may not be stated, but your attitude in class still matters. It influences how we decide what your final grade would be. To illustrateIsko A may not be the brightest in class, but he makes every effort to turn in course requirements and participates in class activities. Sem ends and his computed grade is 1.8xx. Isko B gets the same grade of 1.8xx, but is often late or absent. Not only that, hes lazy as hell. Lets just say hes lucky to still get a decent grade. Normally, both will get a final grade of 2.0. But because of Isko As overall attitude in class, he gets a final grade of 1.75 while Isko B remains at 2.0 or even 2.25. Bottom line the 4.0, INC, or 5 that you got couldve easily been a 3.0.Hope this helps  P.S. I apologize if this is not as exciting and titillating as the other confessions. P.P.S. Yes, nakakaexcite at nakakabuhay talaga. ; - YourfriendlyneighborhoodProf,1998, Arts and Letters
Dear J,Thank you.We havent known each other for a while but youre one of the most amazing people Ive ever met. To be honest, I cant even remember how we met. Just that Im thankful we did.Your face is funny in that it can convey so many of these weird emotions. Youre funny. Youre straight-forward. You have so many stories, ones which Ill never get tired of hearing because you just seem so fond of the things you tell me. You like a lot of the things I like but never really got the chance to explore. Youre insightful and youre more than what you seem except, I think, you dont really want people to delve too much into that. Its not like youre perfect or anything because you can be an unabashed douche. Thats not totally okay, but thats you.So Id just like to say thank you again. Thank you for being you. Thank you for being there even though you probably dont know or notice it. Thank you for adding more color to my college life.And youre graduating soon so Id just like to tell you sorry because I didnt expect to, but I fell in love with you. I didnt mean it and from the very start I knew you liked someone else, someone I didnt know but definitely existed, but, well, loves love and thats that. Sometimes I feel so stupid because Id just get jealous, but then Id think that this is better than nothing at all.Even though youll never know, thank you for making me feel this way.(Im also sorry because I know you dont like tl;dr posts. -Me, 20**, Engﾒg

Dear Nicole Rocafort,Nakita ko ang post ng isang nagngangalang Mr. Torpe dito sa TDF tungkol sayo. Totoo naman lahat ang sinabi niya pero sa totoo lang mas napakita sa post na yun yung maganda mong physical appearance. But you know what? Beneath that beautiful face na kinahuhumalingan ng lahat, there is something extraordinary in you. Sobrang nakaka-attract ng personality mo. Yes, you are not one of those girls who just wear short shorts or basically just a piece of cloth so that they will catch our (the guys  attention. But you, no matter where you go, napapansin ka talaga and its all because of your pleasing personality, friendly acts towards everyone at yung balancing of life mo in which your academic life does not sacrifice kahit na ang overwhelming ng social life mo. Hindi mo ako stalker but yes, I like you. Hindi ko alam kung kulang lang lahat ng napapakita ko sayo or manhid ka nga lang pero sobrang gustong gusto kita. And I hope someday, youll eventually see that I really do care about you so much. You bring out the best in everyone-especially me. I love you.Sa lahat ng mga lalaki dyan na pagod nang maghintay, this shoutout is for you. Matagal ko nang gusto si Nicole pero sa tingin kong nakikita niya lang ako as a friend pero dahil mahal ko siya, wala sa isip ko na ang goal ko lang sa kanya ay yung sagutin niya lang ako at maging boyfriend. Gusto kong makita siyang masaya palagi. Kaya yung mga taong naghihintay lang na sagutin sila ng mga nililigawan nila at yun lang ang intention, think again and just back out. Girls are more precious than you think they are. They deserve a man who will just not love them purely, but respect them as well.- Mr. Pure Intentions,2013, Engg
Dear P,I will forever bless the day I dropped EDCO 203 under one of our favorite rock stars, because that fateful dropped class led me to find my person. Who would have thought then that we would end up as godmothers of each others children, among other things (you know, haha ?   I am blessed because I have a best friend/sister/ESBR buddy/whatever-else-Ps-do. My son is blessed to have Ninang P. And both of us are blessed by extension because we gained a whole new family in the form of the tribe. Thank Father I dropped that class... and I thank Him even more when I borrowed your notes in FLCD because I did not attend the first few meetings, because that was the start of this now treasured bond. ;  (Just goes to show that you have always been the more responsible one in this friendship. Hehe. So heres to watching the kids grow up, and to passing the porch test with flying colors.- P,2004, Educ
Dear Reader, You are probably a LOT more beautiful/handsome than you think!Are you going to find it weird when you catch a girl staring into your eyes?  How about if she tells you that youre very attractive?I was surprised when I read a certain post here in TDF, the one which expressed excitement for every jeep ride because she/he appreciates the beauty from everyone.I thought I was the only one!  There are countless handsome guys out there, I love staring at your faces.  Just about every jeep I ride, or every street I walk, there are people and even more people to appreciate.  I am not bisexual; Ive had boyfriends, all my crushes are male, and I have no doubt at all..  yet there are so many beautiful ladies out there too!  I cannot help but stare at your faces, whether its your beautiful eyes, your cute nose, or something else.  Sometimes I look around and get very confused why not all these people are staring at each other like I am.  The way I look does not contain anything sexual.  I do not care if you are single or not either, because I am not interested in those things with strangers.  Its simply strong appreciation.  God truly created such eye-pleasing creatures!  I cannot get over the fact that people are so different, yet through all of those differences, they can still all possess beauty.  Sometimes, I get very tempted to tell you how handsome or beautiful you are, but you might get the wrong idea  (such as assume Im a lesbian/ that I want to have sex  so I hold myself back.  Also, when certain guys compliment my looks, I get paranoid that theyre being sweet just to look for sex, so I feel really uncomfortable.  I dont want to creep you out.  I wish there was a way to tell you how attractive you are, or maybe ask for your photo, in a way that you can see the sincerity in my compliment and intentions.   Stay beautiful/handsome.  - Human Appreciator,2013, Engineering

Dream school ko ang UPD. Salamat sa Kikomachine Komix, relatives and pure curiosity, kinulit ko ang nanay ko na i-enrol ako sa isang review center at magtake ng entrance exam sa UP. Syempre, sa pag-fill-out ng form, first choice ko ang Diliman campus. Pumili pa nga ako ng non-quota para mas mataas ang chances na makapasok.Fast forward sa paglabas ng UPCAT results, nakapasa ako. Pero hindi Diliman. Dun sa Extension Program sa Pampanga. Napakasaya ko nun pero may konting lungkot dahil hindi sa first choice ko ako nakapasa. Pero nabuhayan ulit ako ng loob. Kasi nga naman diba, Unibersidad ng Pilipinas e. I was one of the privileged few na nakapasa. Thankful ako. Pero minotivate ko ang sarili ko na piliting mag-transfer papuntang UP Diliman.Fat forward ulit present time. Hindi ko na hinihiling ang paglipat sa Diliman. Masaya na ako sa kung nasaan ako. Nagagawa ko kung ano ang gusto ko. Nakakapag-aral ako nang mabuti. Never akong naligaw sa campus. Natuto akong maging independent. Love ko mga kaibigan ko. Hindi nga lang fruitful ang lovelife, pero nag-UP ako para mag-aral at para mailibot ko sa ibat-ibang lugar ang mga magulang ko pag may magandang trabaho na ako. And Im good with that.Wala lang. Gusto ko lang i-share.  - Licorice, DEPP

Ever since I was 14 years old, I have always had that perverted girl inside me. Siyempre, dumaan ako sa stages ng paging perverted.Stage 1 Curiosity Eto pa yung stage na umaasa lang ako sa mga intimate moments sa TV para ma-experience ko yung kakaibang pleasure sa loob ko. hindi ko pa maintindihan kung ano yun eh. Siyempre naghanap din ako ng mga ganung moments sa mga libro namin sa bahay at yun meron nga. Ang sarap talaga nung feeling eh.Stage 2 The Existence of the InternetOf course umabot sa point na kulang na yung nakikita at nababasa ko lang. Bitin eh. At dito na pumasok ang internet. Ang saya eh. May porn at Erotic Stories akong na-discover. Pucha ang sarap manuod kahit na malapit lang kapatid ko. Siyempre patago ako manood at magbasa. Natuto din ako mag-delete ng history at mag-cover-up.Stage 3 Masturbation ExistsNung 13 years old ako, nabanggit sa class na di daw maganda masturbation but my teacher never explained. Never ko inalam kung ano yun. But of course, one day, I learned about it. Di ko matandaan kung paano nagsimula eh. All I remember is that I was reaching my vagina and played with it. Dun ko nalaman na mas masarap yung ganun! Of course di pa ako nag-orgasm the first time. A few tries and I have reached one of the most pleasurable feelings orgasm. Stage 4 Obsession and OthersI was well, I liked the feeling of it but of course I was always feeling guulty afterwards. Yung guilt ko kahit na 3 years na ako nag-mamasturbate, di pa rin nawawala eh. But I still did it. From once a month naging once every three weeks hanggang sa naging once a week. By this time, pleasure but sobrang guilt na na-experience ko eh. Di ko alam gagawin. I still do it. Umabot sa sex chat sa omegle. But I will always feel guilty. Stage 5 PauseOne day, I watched a Koreanovela. I was sooo in love with the show that I have dreamed of having the same love story. But then I realized, I wont be the same as that girl. Im not as pure as her anymore. And so, because of this, I stopped masturbating. I wanted to be the girl na pure but I know I cant have that. Stage 6 Dreams and the subconscious And then, after three weeks of no masturbation, I dreamts for the first time a sexual dream. I realized I missed the feeling. So I did it. And the feeling of guilt was way heavier than before. So I stopped again. But it happened once again after three weeks. I know I can no longer ignore it. Last Stage AcceptanceAfter my most recent masturbation, I realized that I will never be the pure girl anymore. This is who I am. I am a virgin girl but a very perverted one. It was the first time I accepted this part of me truly, not as a separate part of me. So, Im never going to be that pure girl but it doesnt mean I cant have my love story right?P. S.Sorry for the long post. It was an epiphany of some sort. Well, here is an epiphany,2011, CSSP
Every year nalang, na-iinggit ako sa Engg Week. Tagal ko nang nasa college at hindi parin ako nakaka-move-on sa inggit ko sa mga engg students.

Ewan ko bakit, pero sobrang laking turn-on para sa akin kapag yung girl pino-ponytail yung buhok niya.Parang feeling ko nagmu-multiply yung cuteness factor dahil sa ponytail eh.Kaya nga minsan, kung dadaan ako sa AS o kung saan maraming tao, napapatingin talaga kaagad ako sa mga girls na may ponytail eh.At dahil malapit na magpasukan, sabik na muli akong mag ponytail-hunting muli! Baka nga as early as this coming enrollment period, mag-hunting na ako eh.Ponytail Lover,2011, Social Sciences and Philosophy

First day sa LArch 1.I was waiting for the prof to arrive and dahil masipag akong estudyante (or dahil un lang kasi class ko for that day  ang aga kong pumasok.Siyempre la pa si prof. Solo pa lang ako. Nagantay at umupo sa center ng bench. I was enjoying my solo time when a flirting couple arrived and chose to sit on my left side. I didnt mind it kahit single ako at NBSB. I just continued whatever I was doing. A few minutes after, another flirting couple arrived and chose to sit on my right side. This time I was thinking, Ugh! Please. Ang daming vacant benches. Bakit ninyo dito pinili maupo? Ofcourse, that was just me muttering to my already-starting-to-be-annoyed/jealous self-while-being-surrounded-by-these-flirty-and-touchy-couples.But well, whatever, tried not to care. Minutes later, you arrived (im a girl btw  and you chose to sit next to me and in between the flirting couples. I glanced at you and noticed that you had been a classmate of mine and had been my happy crush back then but we werent able to get close with each other. I was so so happy. I thought that finally, hindi na ako nag-iisa.In my mind, thoughts like makikilala mo kaya ako? or kakausapin mo kaya ako? or is this it? has my moment finally come?I was the shy type of girl and i think you were also kind of shy and i think you barely remember me. The clock ticked, the couples still flirting while i was waiting...and waiting...and waiting...The room has been opened. We started the class and the rest is history. That was the closest that we have ever been.Well, thank you na rin, dahil you made my last sem a bit something to look forward too. = -thankful girl, 20**, CMC

I just wanna establish the ff truths which are open for your opinions1. Christianity is not a religion or philosophy, its a relationship and a lifestyle - Rick Warren. This means that being a Christian is not dependent on what doctrines or values we subscribe to but solely on accepting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior and how we cultivate our fellowship with God through the study of His Word, prayer and fellowship with other believers2. Being homosexual is a matter of CHOICE. You see, life is not a matter of chances but of choices. In as much as it wasnt by chance that you are a UP student. You couldve been forced by your parents to pursue this or that degree but in the end, you had all the freedom to choose. Importantly, Christianity is never by chance but by CHOICE. Yes God loves each one of us, and Yes Jesus Christ died for our sins. But God is a just God and so He gave us the freedom whether or not we would want Jesus to be in our lives. Hes just there knocking in each one of our hearts (Revelations 320  and we have the choice to let Him in or not. And the choice is TOTAL surrender, or not, theres no gray area. 3. Homosexuality is not a sin. But doing homosexual acts like same-sex intercourse is a SIN. And theres no such thing as a greater sin or greatest sin. You hate your brother and its like murder, you look lustfully to a person and its like adultery (1 John 315 . Cheating in your exams is a SIN, and this isnt less of a sin than having same-sex intercourse or pre-marital sex for that matter. The good news is that, these have ALL been overcome by Christs death on the cross. And we go back to point 1, its either you accept this fact or not (again, theres no gray area, 1 Corinthians 153 . We just need to CONFESS our sins and He will definitely forgive us (1 John 19 4. Sex was primarily created for procreation by a married couple. Second, for pleasure - ONLY between a husband and a wife. Any deviation from this is considered a SIN. And same-sex intercourse, pre-marital sex, sex outside of marriage are no different at all as theyre all SINS. So there shouldnt be any condemnation on the part of those gay couples who choose to stay that way and to those adulterers or even to those teenagers hungry for pleasure through sex. Condemn homosexual acts but condemn yourself too for your frequent lies. Theyre both sins anyway.5. I myself have had homosexual tendencies, I had same-sex intercourse a few times (and this was when I was already a Chritian . And sure I had pleasure. But I CHANGED. I changed because I know I wasnt pleasing God by sinning. I am not perfect after all, and so are you and all people who belong to the LGBT community. Temptations are everywhere but God will give you the grace enough to overcome each one of them (1 Corinthians 135 6. We should foster love instead of hatred, we should help each one of us know who really God is and in the end, it will be God who is to JUDGE whether or not somebody is worthy to be called His CHILD.7. I wanna be your friend, yes you who are reading this. And yes, God wants to be your friend too, your MOST SPECIAL friend.  - Changed by grace,2007, CSSP

Gusto ko lang ipagsigawan sa mundo na one year na kami ng partner ko. Pareho kaming lalaki. hihi <3 <3 <3Pero bad news, twenty years na sila ng misis niya. </3Ang hirap din palang maging husbands lover. Akala ko nung una kebs lang. Ill do it for sex. Exciting kasi talaga.  Yung tipong kapag mag-isa ka, mapapangiti ka kasi maaalala mo yung mga crazy sexcapades niyo around the campus (sa car, sa stairs ng UPFI, sa office niya somewhere sa campus, sa UP hotel . Pero eventually feeling ko, parang na-fo-fall na rin ako sa kanya. Kasi lately, yung boses niya, yung smile niya, at yung halik niya yung nami-miss ko. He looks really young for his age kasi talaga. Maganda katawan. yummy. Gwapo. Sweet din siya. So while kaya ko pa, Im saying goodbye to him na. Gusto ko na rin kasing maging legal wife.      Husbands Lover 2008 Science
Gusto ko lang sabihin na masaya ako sa sorority na sinalihan ko. Nakahanap ako ng mga sisses na sisters talaga ang turing sakin at mga brods na brothers talaga ang turing din sakin. Walang seniority o power tripping. Kapag naging sis na, pantay-pantay na ang lahat, syempre respeto na lang sa leader namin. Wala ring kahalayang nagaganap dahil gentleman lahat ng brods, hindi ko maisip na may ganun silang gagawin.Nakakalungkot nga lang kung totoo man ung mga nakasulat tungkol sa ibang sorority. Pero sa mga gustong sumali ng soro, wag kayong mag-alala. Makakahanap din kayo ng soro na para sa inyo. Marami rin naman dyang matitino.- Proud soro member,2009, CHE

Gusto ko sumali ng JMA. Hindi para pumarty or makipagsosyalan but because of this one girl na naging classmate ko sa isa kong GE.Ang ganda ganda niya. Filipina beauty. Alam kong sosyal siya dahil lahat ng gadgets niya Apple. Kung paano rin siya manamit, simple ngunit alam mong branded. De kotse rin siya. Pero ang gaan gaan ng loob ko sakanya. Napakabait niyang tao at higit sa lahat, hindi nangmamaliit. Hindi ako mahirap pero hindi rin ako may kaya, swakto lang. At alam kong alam niya yun. Pero tinrato niya ako na parang equal niya. Inaalok pa nga niya ako minsan ng pagkain kahit hindi naman kami nag-uusap talaga. Nung minsang naging groupmates kami sa isang report, nakita ko kung gaano siya kasipag magtrabaho at quality work talaga ang gawa niya hindi lang basta matapos. Mahilig rin siya mag-joke at napakacorny minsan pero tatawa ako kasi ang cute niya. Hindi ko na maalala kung paano ko nasabing mabait siya pero basta isa siya sa mga pinakamabait na nakilala ko sa UP    Masiyado na ako nasanay sa mga mayayaman na nangmamaliit o tila bang hindi nangangausap ng mga tulad ko. Pero iba sya, ibang iba sya. Noong panahon na yon parati siya tumatawag ng mga sponsors para sa event nila. Ginawa ko narin yun para sa org namin kaya alam ko. Maaga siya parati sa class at nakatayo sa labas ng classroom. Ako naman si tabi, tabi lang sakanya, patay malisya. Something about lights yung event nya. Lagi ko pa siya naririnig na nakikipagtawanan sa sponsors, nakakatuwa, parang charming talaga siya. In-add ko siya sa Facebook at binilang ng mga 2 weeks bago niya ako i-accept. Muntik na ako mawalan ng pag-asa nun. Kaka-stalk ko sakanya, mas lalo kong nalaman kung ano yung event na tinutukoy niya at na taga-JMA nga siya. Napabilib ako kasi akala ko puro parties lang talaga ang JMA, pero hindi naman pala.  So nagpunta ako sa event niya, nakita ko siya, nag-hi siya sakin pero yun na yun. Siguro iniisip niya lang napadaan si classmate niya, pero ang di niya alam nag-cut pa ako para dun.Siguro mababaw para igeneralize na dahil sakanya magandang org ang JMA pero swerte ang JMA na mayroon silang isang member na iidolohin ng iba hanggang sa puntong gusto na rin sumali upang mapalapit lang sakanya Siguro nga may mga mayayaman na matapobre talaga pero sana wag niyo sila igeneralize lahat dahil itong babaeng to, binago niya ang paningin ko sa mayayaman. Shes perfect to me. Mabait, maganda, masipag, matalino nakakaiyak nga eh. Niligawan ko ba siya? Hindi. Magaaral ako at magtratrabaho ng mabuti para pag nagkataon na makita ko siya muli, hinding hindi ko na siya papakawalan. <3 <3Chika!  - May Pag-asa,2012, CAL

Hello. My confession will be short and sweet. We had been together for a number of years but I didnt really *love* you.The fact is, Im gay, and I used you to cure my illness. I know its sick. I had been dating other guys while we were together. Every reason I gave for letting you down was a trap, and you always fell for it. And now, I have finally mustered up the courage to end this relationship, even though I havent told you the whole truth. I am now happy with my partner because I feel all of this is real. Thank you for helping me realize what I really want. I know you will find the right person for you. I will always be here if you need any help. - Meneses,2013, DEPP (UP Pampanga

Hi Deo,Weve met way back in June. The first time I saw you, well I must say, you got me hooked up on you right away. On the same day when I first saw you, I met you. My first impression on you was different on how I met you. I thought you were one of those guys who is a snob and wouldnt approach people because you look like one of them. The thing is, youre different. You are very approachable, and I really had a lot of fun when I met you. I was happy. After that you left, but you never left my mind.Months have passed and I dont see you anymore and for four months, I easily lost the crush feels I had for you, but now, I began seeing you regularly again. I am so jealous of the people who are so close to you. I wish I was one of them. I wish I could bond with you. I wish I can meet you personally. I wish that I will stop wishing already and start doing things to make them come true. But its hard. All I can do is stare at you then smile at you whenever I get the chance. Last Thursday, that was the first time I saw you dance live with UPSDC. You dance really really really really xinfinity well! I was so happy to see you dance. I was happy not only because you were so hot on stage but because I know youre happy when you dance. There would be times when I see you alone. On those times I want to walk straight to you and talk to you, make you laugh but then my brain suddenly works. I begin to overthink. I began thinking I f I talk to him, I would look desperate. If I talk to him, he might notice that I like him.  If I talk to him, I might bore him. I make a lot of negative assumptions, so then I end up just watching you.I know youll never like me back. Im sure of that. But you should know that there exists this girl who likes you and appreciates your existence. Maybe if we get close, I will confess to you who I am. I hope if that happens, if ever we become close friends, I will actually lose my feelings for you. Dont worry, I dont want you to fall in love with me because I know that you deserve a girl whos good-looking and better than who I am. All I want is to be your friend, your close friend.. or hopefully your best friend.I hope this doesnt creep you out.So close and yet so far  201	 Engineering

Hi, Im not from UP Diliman or any of the UP campuses, but Im sincerely hoping that this will be posted. Thank you admins of TDF if you decide to post it.  When I was in fourth year high school, I tried the UPCAT. I wouldve passed if I just studied and not just winged it, and procrastinated for days until the day of the exam came. Because I knew that there were two subjects out of the four that Im good at, not that Im being arrogant, I thought that if I perfected that two, then I wouldnt need to study for the other two because it would pull my grades up. I was seriously an idiot back then, and if i could just turn back time, Id study so hard that Id be accepted.  Anyway, I had the choice to be reconsidered, but i didnt take it, and (Im seriously honest  when I first heard about the Oblation run last week, I got curious. And then I wanted to be there, not running around naked and rallying for a cause, but staring at them and if I had the chance, get a rose -- something I heard that they give to a person, etc.Im not a pervert, im a girl and I just want to see the reactions of the others when the oblation run starts. (Thats what she said. Lol. You guys rock. Especially those who joined the Oblation run. - fan of oblation, outside UPD
Hi, this is not a mindblowing sex tale, jebs chronicles or gender plot twist post.I admire UP so much that I almost argue with my parents. Before, they pushed me so hard to study in UP, *insert stereotyping and mainstream description of UP*, I told them that I dont want to because theres a lot of frats and such things and it made me feel unsafe. Years had passed, I went to UP. There was this building which stunned me to death. I love this course so much and I didnt expect that its college/institution building would inspire me more. As we were walking around UP Diliman, Im fascinated with every place I see. And yes I could say that there was a sudden change of heart... and perspective.Im a person whos attached to freedom and open space so much. And in that moment, in that oval, I could see myself running again. I thought I would never run again, but that oval made me want to do it again. Those people who were practicing for their performance, idk, they amaze me. Even the circles of friends who were scattered around the university, it was also something. Then the library. The tennis court. The monay haha, yes. As I was standing in the middle of somewhere, right at that moment, Ive decided that UP has what I want in my life.And now that Ive found TDF and TEF, nothing changed my mind about my love for UP. I dont mind those sexcapades, frat wars, prof-student issues, dorm/roomies rants, university system defects, or whatever else. Im after UPs freedom, liberty, and academics. Maroon it is.One last thing, the reason why I also admire UP so much is that unlike other universities,  in UP, I feel like I dont need to be like this and that to fit in. Yes I know theres that brackets that somehow make a gap between some students, but its not what I mean. What I mean is, theres the liberty and freedom. You can be yourself, you dont have to buy things just to look like youre a part of it or of something. If you know what I mean.Kudos Maroons! - Prof in the process

Hindi makukumpara sa apdo, kape, at ampalaya ang pagka-bitter ko.You were both freshies, I was 2nd year. I took Math 1 just to complete my MST requirements. It was a big, cold room. I was sitting at the back, unnoticed by most. First day of classes, both of you were late, so you had no choice but to sit at the sides. You were best friends, no doubt. Both of you are good looking. Coming from CMC, the land of bent people, it wont surprise me if you two are together already.You werent listening to our profs lectures, much less her lame jokes. You were both too busy fooling around and apparently, translating songs (I remember hearing Payphone and Jet lag . I found it funny and amusing.I thought that was just a happy crush. I never took that subject seriously, but seeing the two of you really delighted me. Handsome boys cuddling each other with curses had never been so hot. One requirement for the course was a group report. I badly wanted to be on your group, but fate had other plans. You reported on philosophical fallacies. It was the first time I actually listened to a report. You were wearing formal attire just because. You looked cute. I even won a Stiko-O in your game. That was the best Stik-O I ever had.Two sems after, I saw the two of you with your friends at the AS Steps. You looked more mature. You still have those mischievous looks on your faces, the thing I loved about the two of you. I can tell youre still close to each other. I dont mean that in a gay manner. I meant that in a bro-to-bro manner.See? Thats what Im bitter about! You have more chemistry than I had with all my exes combined! Oh, how I wish I knew the two of you more. You seem to be fun guys!

I admire guys who value their chastity--like those who choose to be virgins until they get married. I feel that in most societies, guys receive a greater stigma if people find out that theyre still virgins while in/after college.

I am not gifted with a beautiful/pretty face and Im just not really into wearing make-up. Marunong ako mag-apply ng make-up pero nakakatamad kayaaaaaa tapos kailangan pa i-retouch?!But I am confident that I am really attractive. I carry myself really well. I make sure that I smell good and that I am always well-groomed. Plus, I have a partyrockin body that I maintain with workout from my PE classes and a lot of walking around UP campus.Meron akong mga guy friends and orgmates na gwapo, matalino, mayaman basta halos lahat-lahat na ng lalaking pinapangarap mo... kapag nagsuot ako ng kabog na outfit and walk like a rampmodel, lahat sila nagtitinginan! May mga jawdropping anf headturning moments pa nga! Ganun din kapag napapadaan ako sa tapat ng tambayan ng mga frat. Hindi lang sila nagsasalita pero ramdam na ramdam ko na sa pagtingin pa lang nila, may matindi silang pagnanasa saken. Baka nga hindi lang nila maamin sa sarili nila kasi nga I dont have that prettyface. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! XDKaya ko silang akitin at landiin (proven and tested lifeskill ko na yun, maski nga sa straight/lesbian/bi/trans  tumatalab eh.  pero hindi ko lang ginagawa kasi mga friends ko sila.

Confidence-booster na din sakin na gusto nila ako palaging ka-hangout. Kusa silang lumalapit at nakikipag-usap sakin kapag nakaupo lang ako mag-isa sa tabi.    Ah basta! Di man ako maganda..

I dont really believe in LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT but... Heres the story.I attended a dance workshop of UP Streetdance Club this December. I tried to invite friends so I could talk to someone and enjoy learning styles and dance choreos,  but they couldnt make it, so I attended the class alone. Being alone that time while waiting for the class to start, I began to look at the people around me, imagining what style is/are their forte/s and a lot more. I was too shy to talk to anyone of them so I failed in making new friends.Then a girl coming up caught my eye, I dont really know why but, I kept looking at her. She even knew those who would teach us, so I assumed that she is a part of UP street  During the first class, I was so eager in learning the choreography. I was enjoying the whole time. It took me a while to master the steps but this girl just danced so well and with ease. I just got struck with Cupids arrow. >Hello kay ateng naka grey pants and black shirt that time !

I dunno how to start this. Well, ill just do it by this..When I was in Philippines the last time. It was UAAP season and a friend of mine invited me to watch the Cheer-dance competition. Thousands of people were there including myself. The first time I saw people from U.P I was very amazed with them and until now I cant still move on from that moment. So, after that I used to be fan of people who studies at U.P. because they have these witty minds  and they are simple people. I really dunno why I so love people who studies at this university. I was wishing to enroll but I think my IQ doesnt fit in to there level. Well, I just want to say that I LOVE ALL PEOPLE WHO STUDIES AT U.P even if I dont know them and they dont know me too. <3 so much love   -

I enjoy spending my free time in the library, specifically Engineering Library 2, because of the comfy seats, the free WiFi, and overall interior design. I know Im not the only person who likes staying there. Being one among many people in the library shouldnt be a problem, but it does piss me off when hordes of students go there to just chat LOUDLY all day. Ive also noticed that most of these noisy people are freshies due to the topics of their conversations. Dear freshies, it is not wise to brag about your Math 17 grade especially when upperclassmen are around. Most of us are done with the math series, and weve been through more than you. As a matter of fact, some of us go to the library to study for other subjects (ES, majors, etc.  that might just kill you. Please dont say engineering is easy. You barely know anything. Have a shred of humility. It doesnt hurt. And if you really need to make some noise, get a discussion room. There are usually four of you anyway.- Annoyed Library Girl,2010, Engg
I graduated from an all boys school. Never had a girl friend since birth, though I had girl crushes once in a while. I was a victim of bullying during my grade school and high school days. It was that bad that I would always be bothered since I know its not true. It came to a point that i was numb and didnt care anymore what people say about me.When i came to UP, I felt really at home. I felt accepted and I was able to act and just be myself. I actually had a huge crush on my GE classmate that timeﾅ.she was so pretty that i never had the guts to tell her since I felt I wasnt good enough for her. I also had a crush in this female athlete from the national teamﾅtoo bad she was too young for me.But I met a certain friend last year, he actually made me realize that I am also attracted to guys, thus making me Bisexual. I was actually happy because I felt free and someone actually understands me and this things happening inside me that I cant explain. Too bad, it wasnt meant to be and we eventually parted ways. Fast forward, had another guy after him, but none of them lasted really flourished into a relationship. Though I was Bi, i would still imagine myself having my own family in the future, marrying the girl I love and having kids too you know.So when the new year came, I stared to rethink things. Its 2014, its my chance to start all over again, another chance for me to fix things and change for the better. Now that Ive really moved on from my past, for some weird reason, I didnt want to by bisexual anymore. For once I wanted to be proud of my partner, like I can shout to the world that I love my partner without any hesitations, I want to be open about it to everyone, I want to be in a relationship that would make me really happy and make me feel good about it. Its kinda hard to explain, but day by day, I discover more reasons why I dont want to be Bi anymore. I also took as a sign, that none of the guys i had flings with, never turned into a real relationship. And I really envy those couples who are really sweet with each other while walking or chilling around UP. In short, my new years resolution is to be straight again, and hopefully find that girl of my dreams. To them l that I had flings with, though things didnt work out, I still had a blast, every moment of it, good or bad, Ill always remember them. No Regrets. Maybe, its just not meant to be. I wish you all the best, and Ill still be here for you, promise! I know you guys will judge me on this, but what can I do, gender is really fluid, I can attest to that. I may have said this a couple of times already, but this time, I want to take this seriously.

I just wanted to say hello to that girl with the loud voice, the big smile, and the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen.You probably dont know me. Well, I dont know you personally either. But now that I know you by face, I will look for you everytime I go to Plaridel Hall.It was sembreak so there werent many people there. It was my first time in the building, and I asked the security guard where the bathroom is. I walked right in, but I heard someone say Ate Irene thank you talaga ah! and for some reason I wanted to go to that direction instead.Apparently Ate Irene was the girl at Plaridel Halls photocopying station. The two of you were talking when I mindlessly blurted out Saan po ung banyo? when I totally knew where it was. Kuya diretso ka tapos kaliwa. you replied with a smile, as if weve already met before. I was still thinking of something to say. I still wanted to talk to you. I wanted to know who you are. But I was a coward that day.I went back the next day and you werent there anymore. I was about to leave when the guard asked me if I was looking for anybody. I described to him what you looked like and what you wore the day before, and all he said was Basta alam ko Broadcomm yun. Nakalimutan ko na pangalan niya eh. Pero mabait yun!Thats all I know about you. I really hope this gets to you and I get to meet you again.  -Sembreak Boy,2011, CSSP

I love Engglib. I am very proud to say that. Feeling ko hindi kasi masyado na-appreciate yung ginagawa ng Engglib staff para sa mga students. Feeling ko taken for granted lang yung facilities ng Engglib. I love how they offered free umbrella rental services during the rainy season.. and how they have Film Fridays to showcase documentaries and stuff from Nat Geo among others whole day long... or how the staff are so active in their social media drives... letting students know what they can rely on from the library.. or how they all seem to be creating a brand of their own with the awesome Engineering Orange theme. I love how they have beanbags and wide spaces and up-to-date computer facilities and discussion rooms with well-distributed airconditioning. I feel so secure and at home in the library.Many people may fail to realize just how awesome the Engglib is because they mostly just go there during stress days to study or fulfill requirements. This post is to let the hardworking staff know that they have a satisfied patron--especially if nobody said it before. Especially now that the lib has longer operating hours... I can finally put it to good use. There is SOME room for improvement though. Sana di na masyadong mataray yung ibang staff... aside from that wala na masyadong maidagdag pa sa library. Coffee shop siguro para mas maraming gagamit for the late-night project making, marami po yung mag-aappreciate pag meron pong coffee shop, promise. Kikita pa kayo. Suggest nyo yun sa dean   Tsaka... sana may CR sa loob (particularly for Engg Lib 1 , medyo unfair na staff lang makakagamit... anlayo pa kasi ng CR e.. especially kung mag-isa ka sa lib at di pwedeng iwanan yung gamit mo. Tsaka sana may small section dedicated to leisurely reading... yung ibat ibang book na not necessarily engineering related. Like Game of Thrones or Harry Potter, etc. It will promote a balanced reading life for the stressed students of Engg... anlayo pa kasi ng CAL para manghiram nun eh. Provide these and I guarantee that the libraries of Engg will be filled with more students that will avail of your services and will appreciate your efforts to make life better for them. With the funding that we receive, Im sure that can be arranged. People like me want to be in the library for the peacefulness of enjoying the books and the atmosphere that it has. Im not motivated to read a book because its a requirement. I want to read because I want to and for the enjoyment of reading. It would help if there are other types of books.Hope youll gain something from my input, Engglib. Keep up the good work. Ill say it again--I love you D-Its libro lover.. boy,2012, Engineering9/27/2014 010216

I met this guy through Omegle a couple of weeks back. He was quite the sweet talker kaya even after that Omegle interaction, I agreed to meeting him up. But before meeting him, he asked for my number. He texted me almost everyday. He called a few times. Idk why, but it never crossed my mind to asl for his facebook account, he never asked for mine, too. Maybe because I was enjoying his virtual company a lot, I didnt find the need to know him better through his social accounts.We agreed to finally meet last night during the Lantern Parade. I was excited, I was anxious to meet him. Our meeting place and time the FA lantern 600 PM. It was crazy, but I find it exhilarating too to find someone in the crowd. So around 545ish, I was already around the oval looking for the FA lantern. When I found it, I walked giddily to it, my eyes wandering for that boy in red shirt with white baseball cap. I saw some guys, but they werent you.  So I just kept marching with the FA crowd wearing the brightest green dress I have  so youd easily spot me. Minutes passed quickly and I was beginning to feel a little nervous. Nervous that you might not come and nervous that you might be in trouble. Around 700, I called your number, but could not reach it anymore. I took it as a sign that our short-lived romance was going to be a part of our memories already. As I started to walk away from the crowd, I heard someone shouted my name. I thought I was imagining things, but I heard it again. And as I turned around, I saw this beautiful boy in red shirt and white cap. I was frozen for a while, he was too beautiful than I expected. Not that I didnt expect him to be cute and all, but darn was he drop dead gwapo. He walked up to me and gave me a hersheys kisses (isang piraso lang talaga! Inside joke  and I hugged him.Idk where this will lead the two of us but thanks to TDF and story sharers here. I was reading here when  a story about Omegle was posted. I got curious about Omegle and gave it a try, thats when I met him. So thanks TDF community, you paved the way for me to meet this smart and beautiful guy.

I think Im addicted to beer. Ako lang ba ang umiinom ng beer (or any other alcoholic beverage, beer lang kasi afford ko haha  on the day of an oral exam or an interview? As someone with horrible anxiety, 2 or 3 beers seems to be the perfect amount of alcohol to put me in a more confident and able state of mind. No slurred speech, no inebriation, no hangover. I wish it were socially acceptable and/or not as detrimental to my health to drink (by myself  every day while going about my normal routine. I cant drink during school hours, but almost every day when I get home, Ill have a few beers. It helps me to think about my day objectively -- decisions I made at work, mistakes, improvements for the following day, etc. I also do regular chores / errands while Im buzzed. On weekends, I allow myself to get as drunk as I want, which helps reduce my desire to over-drink during the week. Overall, I just feel more like myself when Im buzzed.

I used to be really weight conscious dati. Like, bordering anorexic na. Nagawa ko na nga yung eat-absolutely-nothing day. I drank laxatives and did everything (exercise, etc  I can just to decrease my weight and make my waistline smaller. I became obsessed with weight loss stuff. Because I was feeling drowsy and weak all the time, palagi din akong nagkakape even though I didnt want to. And I was damn cranky all the time.I felt superior. People were somehow praising me for it. Or maybe those were the only ones I really thought about. I was one of the thinnest in the school and I felt it was the only way I was ever going to be noticed. Because I was beautiful.For me, I sacrificed everything. My grades because I was only focusing on keeping myself thin...and the times I could have had to have fun with my friends and family. Now, I wonder if I never had that stage in my life. I could have had more happy memories. Or even just memories in general. I would have been closer to my friends because they wouldnt have been so scared of me. And my family would never have been so worried about my health.Now, Im okay. I got over that. Im proud to say that I gained weight and most of my clothes couldnt fit. But I know Im healthier and happier. Ang sarap pala ng feeling ng mag-let go lang. Going about with not much insecurities whatsoever. Ang saya kasi I find it easier to smile all the time.So, girls (kasi generally, females have more tendency to be weight conscious , although korni and parati niyo tong naririnig, like, everywhere, whatever size and shape you have, its okay. Kasi people noticing you for your body is not even half as fulfilling as them noticing you for who you are deep inside.  - HealthyPerson,2013, CHE

I want to study Music!Lately, Ive been obsessing over this idea, this dream of studying something I want and feel passionate about. Ive approached my parents about the idea but they seem to take it as a joke, thinking that it is not a practical degree to take up. Im planning after my Engg days to save up enough money to finance myself.Dont get me wrong, Im doing okay in Engg. I can do it. And I like my degree program now. But some part of me just wants to throw away that safety net of a stable future to live out something I want for the first time in my life.I dont know if I could do it though. Im scared. Please dont mock me. The only instrument I have is my voice. And I dont know if Im good enough. Hell, I dont know the basics of Music Theory.

I was trying to search for my previous confession about my Myers-Briggs thing, but I cant find it.I was the one having conflicts whether Im an ENFP or INFP.Well, heres what happened. I re-took Myers-Briggs a lot of times and I got an ENFP again for the second and third take, but an INFP for the two following take. But I took Jung test and it said Im likely to be INFP, because of my whopping 100% preference of my introverted feeling (Fi  and followed by 85% extraverted intuition (Ne , which makes me a Fi-Ne, or simply INFP.That made me confused, so I just made some self-checking. I am a very outgoing, freedom-loving, independent and spontaneous person. Im also extremely idealistic and lives in a myriad of possibilities. I also see good in almost everyone, and as a Christian, I believe God loves all of us, even the worst of criminals and those who dont believe in Him, and everyone is deserving of His salvation. I totally hate wars and conflicts. I make it a point that no one hates me and I have zero enemies. I love to dig deep through the depths of my ideals and imagination and I like the idea that people would just love and accept one another; no hate, no prejudices, and able to reconcile with the differences.Just give me a virtual group hug and God bless you all, guys!! ^_^- ENFP or INFP?

If you ever went to kalay, this is a story of one of the dorms murals. Theres this guy in my college way back 2006. Its the first time I felt that infatuated. We were both in FA. He was at his peak (socially speaking - starring in our college small basketball games, playing in a band, plus he got into our college-based fraternity. So obviously, madami nagkacrush sakanya nung time na yun. A lot happened and it fel like I was battling with other girls for him. One girl even pulled a pregnancy scare on him. I didnt like it. The day I decided to just drop the whole landian thing i had going on with him, nakasabay ko sya maghintay ng jeep sa waiting shed by FA. We talked by the waiting shed not noticing a lot of ikot jeeps already passed by. That was when i decided to give him the ultimatum. And he said he wanted me, and no one else   so blah blah blah ako ang winner hahaFast forward...We were together for almost 2 years (I screwed up . And nooooow, after 6 years, we learned to be close friends again. I just want to thank him for forgiving me, I guess. And though Ive already apologized to him countless times, well this is a lot more exciting when he gets to read it ; Soooo, about the mural.... He was one of the artists commissioned to paint it. So if you happen to drop by kalay, try to find a little part in the wall painting there.

Im a girl. My friend recently introduced me to the wonderful world of yaoi and shounen-ai. Hihi. Ive watched six series in total and my favorites so far are Junjou Romantica and Sekaiichi Hatsukoi. Im following a new series called Love Stage!! and its very cute. For all the fangirls out there, check that one out!After learning the ropes of yaoi, I started looking at my male friends in a different light. I judge their appearance and measure how much BL-able they are. I have this crush whose image and personality is like that of an uke (the submissive partner . He is cute, skinny, kind, and docile. Hes a little tall, though (58  but overall, he has the uke vibes. I get jealous whenever hes with other girls but I feel kilig whenever hes with guys (hot ones, especially . I give special meanings to every smile or gesture he shares with other guys. We have another guy friend whom were both close with. Lets call him S. S, unlike my crush, is a seme. He is buff, aggressive, tall, and very alpha-male. Theres this one incident. My crush and I were on our way to a class we were both attending. He was a little ahead of me when I felt someone tap me on the back. It was S. S then put his arm around my crushs shoulder. You know, that bro-akbay thing. But with this twisted mind of mine, I viewed that friendly gesture in a very non-platonic way. My crush was surprised by the akbay. He glanced at S with a puzzled look. S smiled and nodded at him. I almost died of euphoria then. In my imagination, that scene was happening in slow-mo and everything was sparkly, quasi-yaoi style.

Im a guy but I like to dress up. Not like a drag queen though.I sometimes dress to impress both guys and girls, but thats not the point of my confession.Maliban lang pagkakagusto ko rin sa lalaki, siguro itong want to design clothes at mix & matching womens clothing lang ang masasabing gay-ish traits koPara kasing nalalabas ko yung creativity ko with helping women look good. Di ako parang yung may landi at taray sa pagsasalit kapag tumutulong sa pagdadamit ng babae. Imaginine niyo na lang yung parang lalaking boses na pinagsasabihan kayo kung maganda o pangit yung susuotin niyo.At this moment, tinutulungan ko kapatid ko para madesign yung prom dress niya.Discreet Designer 2012 Science

Im gay and Im sure of it. Lots of people know it too.I like hot guys. I have an athletic body. Not the bodybuilder kind where they have ultra huge muscles. Just ottermode or what you call a swimmers body.I dont act effeminate. I still act straight in every thing I do. I just like men.There was this one time when an effeminate gay wanted to hookup with me since he knew I was gay. I turned him down because I just dont like doing it with effeminate guys. I only hookup with discreet men if possible. I really like hooking up with men who also have good body like me. My gay acquaintances are kinda disappointed because they cannot taste me.

Im looking for a new org so this is more of an inquiry.My first exposure to martial arts was Tae Kwon Do. I stopped when I was kid after getting my red belt (I may have a black belt by now if I continued . From there I went to combat sport, starting with boxing. Now Im in muay Thai. Since then Ive been looking up other fighting styles I could train in like Capoeira, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and Krav Maga. I dont go out looking for violence and fights, but I do love martial arts, combat sports, and everything that goes with them. I wanna transition to Yaw-Yan (Its a Filipino martial art. Look it up. Ill also put a link of a video.  and then completely go into MMA. I was wondering if theres an org in UPD that shares my interest.

Im not from UPD. Im an alumnus of CLSU. I went there to inquire for my Masters degree. The CBA and UPSE registrars were not there, so  I decided to go to Institute of Math. I dont know where it is located. I looked for an Isko whom I can ask directions. I saw a guy in the athletic field, sitting on one of the cement benches. I asked him where is the IM. He then gave me the specific instructions on how to go there. When I went back to where he was sitting, hes not there. thank God that I felt thirsty, so I went to Shopping Center to buy fruit shake. and surprisingly, I saw him again.

Im not really a fan of stars and mornings but someone made me like them.Im not yet a student of UPD. Im from UPM but Ill transfer to UPD.We were together almost the whole day with a friend (so were three and the two of them are from UPD . I like him for quite a while now and it was a joy being with him and our friend. We ate isaw, walked around, and talked. I saw something on his eyes that is so attractive. I dont know. I just look at his eyes, it was a comfort to look at them.We went to his house to play cards. Were having fun but our friend has to leave. I dont want to go home yet so I stayed. He asked me if I want to go to the rooftop with him. I took it as a sign. I must grab the opportunity.So we went to the rooftop. We saw the beautiful sky. He told me that there is Jupiter in the sky. It was also full moon. The clouds were wonderfully placed. It was the first time I appreciated stargazing. Later, he asked me if I like him. I gave a positive response. Everything went well. The feeling is mutual. I was so happy to see the stars with him and knowing that he likes me too. We lay down on the roof feeling the warmth of each other amidst the cold air of the midnight. We kissed and I felt so secured. We waited for the sunrise and my breath was taken away. Ive seen another wonder (the sunrise  besides the stars and him. Im contented.

Im straight, and had my first homosexual experience recently, which I want to share. I got drunk at my friends 21st birthday two days ago. I have a gay friend who likes to take care of people when they start vomiting. So nasa CR ako nun, puking, and he brings in water and starts patting my back; Okay lang yan, (my name , inom ka lang ng maraming tubig, he says. But then he starts to rub my belly and Im thinking what a reliable friend for taking care of me like this. After a while, the vomiting went away, both of us were just lying on the floor while he has his hand up my shirt, rubbing my nipples and stuff,  then we started to cuddle, and my thoughts were that actually feels nice, what a good friend. Looking back, I think I got semi-molested, but whatever.Disclosed2013, Law7/21/2014 163645
Im taking a liking on this girl in our office, but I dont know how to make the first move. No, Ive had a relationship before and Im not gay. Its just I dont know how to be romantic on this crazy kid.While everyone in our team (whos not from UP anyway; were only the UP students in our team  says shes weird, I say shes unique. Shes a geek --- not just physically geek with those big thick black glasses but really one brainy kiddo (an anime geek too!  Shes funny and witty. Both an artist and a musician. Friendly yet snob (one day shed tell how her day was or an update on her favorite anime; the next day she wont talk to me for the rest of the day . Jolly yet serious.

Im the epitome of burgis in UP standards (though I was considered regular in my high school . Im Bracket A, my dad is a lawyer and franchisee, my mom is a banker, I came from a Catholic all-girls-high school and I drive my own car. Im even a member of one of the largest, most conyo orgs in UP. In an effort to teach me the value of money (as their professions both involve dealing with money , my parents always gave me a fixed amount per month since I was a child, then ako na bahala paano gastusin yun. My tuition is already part of that monthly allowance. Ever since I entered college, my monthly allowance increased to 20k per month. I also come from a college thats firm in reforming the STFAP, from professors to students (well, most of . The importance of socialized tuition is discussed at least once in every subject, and I totally understand the reason behind socialized tuition and I understand that its really needed.My confession?Deep down inside, even if I know that theres a need for socialized tuition, I really want it to be free for all, especially myself. When our local student council conducted a stand-making survey, I voted to scrap the STFAP for low cost tuition. Sorry to all my friends who are vehemently pushing to reform STFAP, who tell me to sign this and that then I just say Okay, mamaya-maya just in the hopes that theyd forget. I know its so selfish of me, but I really need the money to buy clothes, shoes, bags, and my daily fix of Starbucks. I honestly cant explain why, but I just do, lalo na sa Forever 21. Im known for dressing well, people compliment me for it, and I just feel happy when they do. Maybe its a psychological disorder or something. Looking back, I was always known as a nerd in high school, but now that Ive entered college where tuition is super low compared to high school, I was able to save a lot of money and use the savings to buy nice clothes. Suddenly I wasnt a nerd anymore, Im a fashionista, popular rich-kid, which really means a lot to me cuz the latter were the type of people who were popular in high school (and who sometimes picked on me . It made me somehow feel high, and then it became an addiction. Everyday Id want to dress to impress until suddenly I found myself not repeating clothes anymore. Back in HS Im just an average girl financially, but now Im on top of the food chain and tuition is really taking away my money for more clothes and more happinessUgh, I feel so disgusted with myself just writing this. I hate it that my happiness is tied to material things, and I hate that I actually want the Filipino people, most of them way poorer than me, to pay for all my tuition so I can indulge in my addictions. But whatever. Ugh.  - Selfish Btch,2011

Isabel SalcedoLooking back at the decisions Ive made as a college student, perhaps the biggest mistake I made in our freshman year was when I decided to forget the feelings I had for you. When we first met, I knew we had a connection, but I let that go and that was really stupid of me. I am still amazed not only by your beauty but also by your cheerful personality, and I still admire you for those great dreams youve always had. Now, whenever I see you or whenever we have our casual hellos, the thought haunts me as I remember how I may have had the chance to be that guy making you happy now. In our small conversations, only one word rings in my head- almost. -That Guy,2012, CBA

Its not really about anything from the UP campus. But Im from the university and Im in love with a girl from ADMU. Shes the kind of girl that stands out in her school and she is also the kind of girl that cant ever be found in UP nor in any place in the world. I just know it.I find her beautiful and cute at the same time. No girl in UP will ever be like her. You might say, duh, everyones unique, but seriously you know what I mean. And shes smart. Probably smarter than most students in UP, even me. (And by the way, she passed the UPCAT Shes the only humble conyo I know. Shes not conyo by choice, but because she cant speak Filipino fluently. And I like her for that because she chooses to be who she is, and not try hard to fit in. With her personality, she naturally fits in as people will just accept her for who she is.Shes selosa when she thinks I like other girls. And she constantly pushes me away every time. She would go Get to know her. Shes just your type over and over again, but I would just get pissed. Always. She cant seem to understand how much I love her that no matter how many girls I look at, shes the only girl that I will ever see. Its like my eyes were made just for her that no amount of pretty would be as pretty as her.Theres are times that I think Ill never amount to something significant with all my frustrations in acads and in life, but when I think of her (which I always do , I realize that shes the most significant thing I have. I always ask myself, why cant I as good as she is?Maybe God put her in my life to complement me. Im not an achiever, but she is. Im simple, shes not. I can describe her in so many ways, but everything would just mean one thing. Shes perfect. Despite her consistent stubbornness and childishness, she is nothing but perfect. She gives me a reason why I should be so proud to be an Iskolar ng Bayan. And how I wish she would see that. It just goes to show that if we open our eyes wider, well see that we, mga Iskolar ng Bayan, arent superior among students in the other universities. It only takes an open mind and a clean heart to see an assumed conyo atenean as who s/he really is, which is a humble person with good intentions. Soon enough, everybody will realize that a UP-ADMU love story is not impossible. After all, opposites attract. Sometimes, all we need is a true-blooded blue in our lives to make everything worthwhile, or just this f*cked up life a little bit livable. And even if Im gay, I can and I will love her straight. Suntok sa buwan, pero balang araw papakasalan ko ang babaeng iyon nang walang alinlangan.#MaroonBlueLoveStory-EnggEnggSayo, 20**, Engineering

Ive liked you since we first became classmates. I didnt actually know who you were until that semester. I was 17. Id always sit at the back of the classroom while youd stay at the very front with your friends. You seemed like a nice guy. I thought you were just one of those boys Id just find attractive and eventually get tired of. But no, to this day, I like you just the same. Its the way you smile, the way you treat your friends, the way you follow your passions in life, and I guess more importantly, for me, the way you loved God like I do. This month, it would be the third year Id have a crush on you.Ill never forget that one field trip we had together. I sat at the very front, alone, because I had no home org and no batchmates (I came from a small school , and therefore, no friends. You on the other hand, it seems like your batchmates (highschoolmates in general  were everywhere in the University, so you knew a lot of people. Plus, youre really popular. You would have sat in the back with all the cool kids if you had rode the bus with us going to the venue. You had an exam that morning along with some other classmates, so you guys had to follow. But going home, you took the bus with us. I was one of the first people inside the bus after we all toured the place. I was tired from walkingﾗhiking, actually. So I tried to take a nap while everyone was still freshening up in the public bathrooms near our bus. Then I heard your voice as you entered the bus. I opened my eyes and I swear for one second I smiled from China to Italyﾗat the very least.Thatﾒs just the thingﾗyou donﾒt know what you do to me. I swear I can write a song about each strand of your hair. You inspire me. I just admire you so much. And any chance to be near you, well, Iﾒd take it. We wouldnﾒt even have to talk. You just have to be there. Thatﾒs enough for me. Thatﾒs why when you walked in the bus I got all giddy and panicky and happy and nervous at the same time. Your voice faded a bit as you walked towards the back. I was a happy kid.Still dead tired, I closed my eyes again and tried to go back to sleep. ﾓMay nakaupo ba dito?ﾔ was all I heard after what seemed like ages of tossing and turning in my seat. I opened my eyes and wouldnﾒt you know it? It was you. You were leaning on the other seat next to me with your right arm. You were a bit slouched to the left. Your head tilted to the left slightly too. Your hair was messed up a bit. And you were smiling at me. So what could I do but smile back? I shook my head, and you took your seat right next to mine. Again, I closed my eyes and leaned on the window. But this time, it wasnﾒt to sleep I was memorizingﾗthe way you were, your voice, the temperature in the bus, the drizzle of rain outside my window. See, I have a hard time memorizing with my eyes open and I didnﾒt want to forget anything. When I opened my eyes again, I didnﾒt know what to do. I couldnﾒt text anyone because there was no signal where we were. The bus hasnﾒt started moving yet so I couldnﾒt take pictures of ﾓall the cool scenery while the bus was moving.ﾔI was awkward. I was uncomfortable. I was nervous. But I was happy. You tried to talk to me. ﾓBaka nahulog langﾔ was what you told me when I was obviously panicking because I couldnﾒt find my phone. ﾓTinatawag ata tayo ni Sirﾔ was what you said when our prof wanted a class photo outside the bus. I hated myself for not saying anything. But thatﾒs what happens when youﾒre at a loss for words. Thatﾒs what happens when youﾒre trying to memorize.Finally, the bus started moving. We were on our way home. A movie played. Finally, something to do. It was an old, funny movie. I tried to remain poised even if I wanted so bad to burst into laughter. So I just smiled a constipated smile every time the funny scenes came on. But you laughed. And I was glad because you were enjoying the movie.  You werenﾒt laughing with me, but you were laughing next to me. And I memorized. And that was enough.It was a pretty quick trip home. We arrived in UP within 30 minutes. It was all over. I had hoped for bad traffic. But 30 minutes was enough for me. You know, when I got home, I thanked God. He just knows how to make things work. I really wouldnﾒt know now if youﾒre ﾓThe One.ﾔ But I sure wouldnﾒt be sad if you were. Maybe if I got to know you better, I could at least make a guess. I just really like you a lot. And I really want to know you more. Thatﾒd be enough.Iﾒll be here memorizing.   Sonre�r, 2011-***** Architecture
Ive never really thought Id fall in love with you. I wasnt  the type who casually hooks-up. I didnt believe that you could actually meet someone decent through Tinder. The sole reason I swiped right was in your picture, you were wearing a UP jacket, too. But I did. Ive fallen in love with you in the most uncanny way, in the most inconvenient time. The brokenness we share is such a beautiful thing. Soon enough, we are in our own whirlwind romance - sharing words, thoughts, gestures and kisses only we can understand. But Im so afraid to hurt you. It pains me a lot seeing you get hurt because you dont deserve to feel that. When you love, I know you give your all. And you deserve someone wholl love you equally, even greater. I want to give you all my love. I do. But I hold back most of the time, and I know you do, too, because of the complexity of the situation were/ Im in right now. I dont want to keep hurting you.  You deserve only the best. Im hoping that the time for us will come soon. Right now, I think I have to straighten things out on my own. Thank you for everything. The time with you has been the happiest Ive been for the longest time. Thank you for giving me the chance to be loved by you. I love you. Ill always will. -Tindergirl,2008, Engineering8/15/2014 123214

L. FletaFrom the very moment I saw you and immediately associated your face with your name, nahumaling agad kayo sayo shet. Tangina, ang gwapo mo talaga, medyo matipuno, and cute din. Lalo na kapag nilalabas mo ang medyo may pagka-shy mong ngiti. Kinikilig ako everytime I see that. You also seem very friendly and nice. Mukhang mahiyain ka rin, given na napapansin kong wala kang gaanong madalas kasama, pero okay lang iyan! Im sure with your cool personality youll gain a lot of close friends.   Sayang lang talaga kasi hindi kita basta-bastang makausap. Nahihiya ako e. (Youre a really cool person I hope I get to befriend you someday. And malay mo, we become close friends. Or even more.

Lantern Parade 2013!To the guy who was carrying the first G of ENGG from the Engineering contingent sa Lantern Parade. Hi! I left my friends for a while to get a better look at you hihi I followed you from Law to Engg. #stalker- I want the G,2012, CMC
Lantern Parade Love AffairHi there!Iﾒm sure youﾒre avid follower of TDF just like Overheard. In fact it was you who introduced these to me. But Iﾒm not sure if you gonna see this post. Lantern parade is near approaching. Last year was the memorable one because that was the time the world conspires in favor of us to meet. Do you still remember that afternoon Friday in college?  You were wearing your orange pants and a white shirt. I entered in the door and there you were sitting in one of those cranky chairs. I donﾒt remember if it was you or me who initiate the hands shake. You were new to our department and I thought you just visited there.  All I remember was your question if I am teaching already when you learned that Iﾒm a graduate student.   Yes, at the age of 21, Iﾒm having my masterﾒs degree program.  We exchanged queries about each other.  And I learned that you are 3rd year but 2nd year standing. You just enrolled in our department because you have under load units and need to enroll subject outside your curriculum to maintain the load you were aiming because youﾒre aspiring for ﾑLaudeﾒ (this was your word . This conversation was vivid in my memory because it all started everything. For unknown reason, and the fact that you have a lot of friends to be with to watch the lantern parade, you chose to watch it with me. Actually, with us because we were four but it was just you and me who went to our respective dorms after the parade. We exchanged numbers and agreed to meet somewhere in college of Engineering to watch the parading of the different lanterns from different colleges and units of the University. We enjoyed it so much. I still remember when you asked me to carry your bag pack as you wear your jacket. (to my mind hey are we closed? This is our first time to meet and you act like we are so closed . But that thing was made my feeling for you comfortable because you didnﾒt see me as elite just like others think. You have your Christmas vacation in your hometown and I stayed here in Manila. The 2-week vacation provided us a time to know more about each other through technology communication devices. We discovered that we have a lot in common. One of the highlights of our friendship/relationship was that when I initiate to fetch you at Airport when you returned back here in Manila after the vacation. And so from then on, we became very good friends. We eat together, gala together and our concern for each other got stronger and feelings seemed to be mutually inclined perfectly. Then, the moment of truth finally came when we were going back to dorm after our gala at Technuhub. We were in the taxi when out of nowhere we held each otherﾒs hand and afterwards you suddenly you kissed me in my cheek. I felt something that made me face towards you and you attempted again and lipped me. I felt the sparks and so I gave in. I donﾒt know what the taxi driver had in mind but we donﾒt mind him. We kissed torridly as if the world was ours until we parted waysﾗyou in your dorm and me in my dorm. ﾓAnd then I love youﾔ was your next text when I got in my room. We became sort of a couple. In fact we tease each other of having marriage though we know that we canﾒt be married. The law forbids =D. Just like ordinary relationship, we faced challenges and struggles and for the record, we overcame them. We enjoyed the feeling of having someone who you can act out your true identity and not hiding in the shadow of what the society expected us to be.  Our nights together in some hotel/boarding houses were so memorable. Not just that we exchanged saliva but that we discover more about each other and that we become the person we really are. Time flies so fast. And the trite saying, ﾑchange is the only thing which is constant in the worldﾒ seemed applicable to us. We welcomed the changes including the agreement that weﾒll remain friends after some things did not come well. Iﾒll not elaborate our misunderstanding because I have moved on and I know you too. The purpose of this letter is to let you know that Iﾒm gonna miss you. I know things will never be the same as they were before. We missed the opportunity of having us together back due to, for me was pride and to you, is not known to me. You are a very good friend to your friends. I salute you for that. Please know that you were a beautiful chapter of my life. I never regretted that night we kissed. Although things are now different, I wish for your success and happiness. I donﾒt know who we gonna share this coming lantern parade with. This would have been our anniversary had it not come to an end.   Iﾒm happy now being single and academic focused. I hope you too as well.  Best regards!-Lantern parade,2012, CHE

Love does find you in a way you are most unsuspecting. I went to CHK in hopes of killing time while waiting for my parents to fetch me. It was just my luck that I was able to catch the WVT and MVT in training, but of course I was more of a WVT fan since I knew most of them (due to their games being more televised . I then decided to watch them train every week and I did.Then one moment came wherein you took notice of me. You sat beside me and asked me if I liked volleyball, I said yes, then you introduced yourself and so did I and we shook hands. I couldnt stop smiling even after the day ended but since I was an app for an org I was busy for a long time and I failed to watch the training.2 weeks came by and I had free time to go and watch you and when I came and took a seat, you approached me with a friend and asked if you could have a picture with me. I was stunned, never in my life did someone ask me for such a thing and you could say I was elated, you asked for my full name and then you added me on FB and things have been great since then.I just want you to know that you have made me happy again. Thank you for all the smiles and the butterflies you have given me and are still giving. Even though you just want to be friends or what, Im okay with it because I have never felt happiness like this. That someone like you, a great athlete, would take notice of me. Thank you and I hope that we enjoy this coming sem together, friends or maybe something more.  -poohbear,2012, CAL
MATH 17.I have already shared this story of mine a lot of times already, most of the time, to fellow iskos and iskas who are very down because of low marks in exams, or when they think of quitting and giving up.I love Math, and I never doubted that ever in my life, except for a period of two weeks during my first semester in college. I failed my first ever long exam in Math 17, the first time (as far as I remember  that I have failed a math exam ﾖ I got just 53%. For the two weeks following the first exam, I felt really down to the point that I almost lost the desire to attend my classes. Yes, I also doubted if I really deserve to be in UP to begin with.The person with a strong personality that I am, this failure served as a great challenge for me. I strived and studied hard; I made sure that I already start studying one to two weeks before my next exams in Math 17. The result 2nd Exam ﾖ 102%, Midterms - 59.5 out of 60, and the good results continued until the end of the semester because of pure hard work and dedication in studying. To top it all, my final grade in Math 17 was a very sweet UNO.This post is not meant to brag about my amazing ride in one of the most feared subjects by Freshmen, but to inspire everyone who will be able to read it. Yes fellow iskolars ng bayan, anything is possible. Yes, failing is not an option. Yes, studying hard and having a strong determination can lead us to things we could never imagine we could have or we could accomplish. I am a living proof to that.OnaBaby, 20**-*****, CBA

Mapaglaro talaga ang tadhana.Boy 1-  Mabait, palabiro at sobrang alaga ako. Nagtapat siya pero ayaw ko masira ang friendship namin kaya naging mailap ako.Boy 2- kaibigan ko din, nagtapat din siya at may sparks pero playboy kaya natatakot ako.Boy 3- kuya type, at taga payo ko. Close sila ni boy 1 at nilalakad nya ito sa akin. Isang araw, nagkasama silang tatlo at na topic ako sa usapan. (Nalaman ko kasi sabi sa akin ni boy3  Parang nagkaroon ng mutual understanding sina boy 1 at 2 na may the best man win pagkatapos ng usapang yun at parang naging mediator si boy 3. Ang haba ng hair ko nung nalaman ko yun. I was overwhelmed and very surprised kasi NBSB ako. But the universe must be conspiring against me because the thing is, Im falling for boy 3.  Ang masaklap? He likes my best friend at ako ang parang bridge nila. I dont really know how my best friend feels about him but she seems to be ignoring his intentions.Palagi pa rin akong nag i-encourage kay boy3 na I pursue si best friend. But deep inside, it feels like a hundred daggers is stabbing my heart. I dare not tell a soul for doing so would overly complicate things.  I guess you can never really have everything.

Marami na rin nag-alok na mag-model sa akin at may ilan akong tinanggap. But the problem is I dont think I deserve a beautiful and sexy girl. Tingin ko, dapat lalaking mas gwapo at mas macho rin sa akin para equal effort kasi kung babae, okay na yung payat. Ang hirap kaya magpalaki ng katawan! Dapat parehas kami ng effort.

Mondays meant no school for us UP students, and for me and my girlfriend, it meant alone time. All my siblings would be out of the house, and wed have the room to ourselves.The morning would always start with her waking me up to a kiss. Usually on my lips, sometimes on my neck, and sometimes shed be wearing something sexy or sometimes she wont even be wearing anything at all.The lock on the door was broken, it had been for the longest time. But weve been doing this for a while, and it was already a given that when the door was closed on a Monday, it was to stay closed.So that Monday morning, she came over as she always did. I was sleeping. She crept under my comforter and she started getting on top of me. She kissed me on the lips, and I started to grab her waist. We made out, while my hands began to move under her shirt. She already had no bra on, this was her surprise from time to time. And when I began feeling toward her sexy ass, she only had her panties on. Another surprise for my morning.I was getting hotter for her by the minute. I squeezed her ass, and she moaned as she clung to me. She loved it when I did that, and it always got her wet. We were both getting hot and getting wet for one another. We both knew where this was going to go, we knew before the day had even started. Mondays always meant hot undisturbed girl on girl sex.So it began, I turned her over and got on top her. She pulled my shirt up and she began sucking on my breasts, while I began to feel her pussy. She bit my nipple as I began to finger her. It started from that, and next thing we knew, we were both naked under my comforter. We were sweaty, wet, and horny. I began making my way down under, and I opened her legs wide open. I sunk my mouth into her you know what and started eating her. The comforter was slowly being removed from our bare bodies by the trembling and quivering from utter pleasure. She started moving around until we got to 69. The comforter was completely off our bodies. And we both licked, sucked, and bit until we decided to finger one another. We didnt stop until we were both out of breath, and we lie flat on the bed.

Most students would prefer professors and instructors na magaling mag-joke at laging napapatawa ang class o tipong young/youthful and very approachable. My favorite professor in college was Dr. Digna Apilado. Nung una ko siyang nakita, I thought I made a mistake taking Kas 1 under her. Nakikita ko na ang isang buong semestre ng takot lalo na nung narinig ko yung feedback ng iba na sobrang strikto/terror nga niyang professor.I was wrong. Or partly right na rin kasi strikto talaga siya.Normally sa likod lang ng class ako uupo at magddrift ang utak away from what is being discussed. But in this one, after the first or second week, sa harap ako umupo. Normally, I donﾒt raise hands para magtanong pero I became the guy who interrupts the professor just to ask something. Madalas, I ask what ifs and tipong why did this happen ganito ganyan. Then dumating na rin to the point na tinanong ko na rin kung anong opinion niya sa nangyari. I think nagmukha nga akong sipsip or overeager student dahil sa dami kong tanong.She was always very eager to answer my questions or perhaps she was quite surprised that someone is asking her kasi maliban sa akin eh iilan lang talaga ang active sa class. But I loved how she discussed Philippine history. Di ko na maalala exactly how, but history became very interesting na parang kinwento lang niya from her memory/experience.Anyway at the end of the semester, nung kukunin ko na yung blue book para makita yung result ng finals eh she told me (parang casual conversation lang outside her room  na I was the first student from Engineering na talagang nakita nyang interested sa kasaysayan and that she really appreciated it. Teary-eyed ako but all that I could say then was ﾓSalamat po.ﾔ I wish I couldve told her na it was all because of how she taught history and that I wish she would teach more years in UP to inspire more students to love history.Dear Maﾒam, you may not remember me anymore pero thank you po ulit. Nagiba na nang tuluyan ang tingin ko kay Aguinaldo at Quezon. Haha.- Kas 1 Lover,2005, Engg
Mr. C,I have always liked you since I saw how witty and powerful you could be in our design class. I cant understand why but you just have this uncanny leverage over me.While others may find you douchey and pretentious for speaking about profound theories in a class discussing facts and concepts that are quite mundane, I did not.On the contrary, I looked at you as a precedent towards building the kind of me who has a deeper and more sensible notion for architecture.I tried reaching to you but I am always dragged back by the thought of you finding me not as engaging as the books you have always been scanning in the library.I said hi to you one time but you never even smirked or smiled back at me.There have been a couple of times when I tried to start a conversation with you but you never treated me more than a ghost roaming around your self-made world and egocentric atmosphere.It has always been just me, who is stucked with the deceitful euphoria of merely watching you from a distance, of sneaking at your thoughts through your social networking profiles, and of hoping that our paths would actually cross one day-even if there are instances wherein we are not even an inch apart.   - Comet, 201X, Architecture
Ms. BA EngStud,I first met your words. Yes, your words. I stumbled upon your tumblr blog last summer. I admit, I was hooked. It took me hours to back-read and sadly, I wasnt able to reach your very first post. I tried but then here comes first sem. I got busy with my classes but I still find time to visit your blog once a while. Although, not as frequent as before. Then on a certain Wednesday, I went out of the classroom since I was too bored in class and I used the excuse that I need to go to the bathroom. I finally saw you in person. Kung hindi ka tinawag ng mga kaibigan mo, hindi ko sana malalaman na ikaw pala yun at ganoon pala bigkasin ang pangalan mo. Cute. I sent you a tumblr ask when I got home, saying that I saw you. Your reaction was cute. Cute naman talaga ng mga reactions at sagot mo sa mga mensahe at tanong ng mga anon. -P Gusto ko sana magpakilala kaso nahiya ako.Napansin ko rin na maaga kang pumupunta sa 1PM class mo sa CAL 5th floor. Nagkaroon tuloy ako ng rason para maghanap ng excuse at lumabas ng room. 12 noon pa lang kasi, andun ka na sa labas ng room niyo. Bakit ang aga mo? Hahaha! Every time Id see you, Id send you an anonymous TA and you still had the same cute reactions. Then you stopped coming to your class early because you were applying for an org, right? Sad but at least, once my class ends, nakakasalubong kita sa stairs. I also noticed how cute your laugh and smile are. At that point, I started to have a slight crush on you. Tapos dumating ang araw na nahulog ka sa stairs. Nakita ko yun. Lalapitan na sana kita upang tulungan ka kaso kasama mo kaibigan mo. Sayang. Tumatak yun sa isipan ko. Bakit? Ikaw kasi ang unang tumawa. Yes, you laughed at yourself. I couldnt help myself but be amazed. I never expected that youd actually laugh at your own clumsiness. Really cute of you. From that then on, I started wishing and hoping that Ill see you more often but it didnt happen. You got busier with your org application. Luckily, tumblr is still there. I made it a point to visit your blog at least two times a week. Again, I am amazed at how beautiful you string your words together.I quote one of your writings, But you know whatﾒs more heartbreaking? Itﾒs when youﾒre just a word. Not a chapter, not a paragraph, not a sentence, not a phrase. But a word. A word that appears only once throughout his book. A single word that will be part of his entirety that he will soon forget as soon as he thumbs through the next page and peruses words more beautiful than your existence. I guess, Im just a word in your book and nothing more. But I do want to say that, again, I quote you, ﾓWe are just another unfinished story;ﾔ that I want to finish together. - -Just Another UP Student (Alam mo yan. ,2011, Engg

My heart beats like the sound of a drum but with a  downtempo, sounding slowly that it feels like at any moment now the music will stop. The heaviness is about to engulf me. Confusion it is that captures my mind. At first I thought it will all be ok. I would feel just right by now being hired in a job that quite suits me, it wasnt that really a source of fulfillment and I was wrong. This kind of situation Im in is new to me and my year just started when it is about to end. I am the saddest person on earth during holidays, this I always think of. I cant help it because most of the time Im with family I am being singled out. The outcast.. And Im trying so hard just to fit in. A cousin of mine asked me a while ago where will you spend Christmas? and made me think I have nowhere. Yes my parents are still alive and I have siblings yet I dont feel like I have them. Years of solitude and confinement made me believe that I have no one else but me. I wished for something, someone, somewhere different than what I had. Its not that the season that is cold but my heart kept in an icebox. Stored so that when warmth is offered I could easily distinguish and appreciate. The kind of appreciation I long for, that warmth of your smile I am encountering once in a while. Grateful to the guy from UP who made me rethink and again believe that Christmas is a season of love. Thank you for giving me reasons to beam a smile.Next time Ill take you on a tour in LB or lets visit Diliman and your Institute Mr. Guy FromUP  - Holiday,2005, Outside UPD

Noong una akong nagkaalagang aso sa kwarto ko siya pinapastay. Tapos kapag naliligo ako at magbibihis na sa kwarto papalabasin ko siya. Na-awkwardan kasi ako kapag nakikita niya akong nagbibihis.

One afternoon, hinatid ako ng first boyfriend ko sa boarding house after my class. When we got there, wala ung landlady namin at walang ibang tao.When we kissed each other goodbye, naging iba ang kiss namin, naging torrid and not just a simple smack. Naging hot kami at doon na nga nangyari. We lost our virginity that time. Yes, parehas pa kaming virgin bago mangyari yun.Dumaan ang ilang days na bumabagabag sa isip ko ang nangyari that day. Hindi ko lubos maisip na Im not a virgin anymore. Alam kong ayon din ang sumasagi sa isip niya. Nagkaroon na din ako ng doubts kung mahal ba talaga ako ng boyfriend ko.And then we talked, we agreed not to do that anymore. He said, not until were already married. And thats when my heart and mind was set to peace. Until now, hindi na nasundan ng ganoong pangyayari and Im so happy about it. I can still feel that Im renewed and that Im still a virgin.   - FirstTime, Engg
One night, I had a really weird dream about me and my orgmate. Simply put, we had sex on the table in our tambayan. We came around five times (for a dream, it was THAT hot . No others were there to see it happen, thank God, because if it happened in real life and someone caught us, I will never live that down. NEVER.After that fucked-up dream, I couldnt look at my orgmate for two weeks, and Id blush heavily whenever I run into him. So one day, he asked me why I was avoiding him. I told him that I couldnt tell him because he might think I was crazy for fantasizing about him. So I told him na may utang siya sa akin na di pa nababayaran since a month ago. Hope he bought that.In all fairness kasi, hes super gwapo, really sexy, great ass and nice lips (which are apparently, his most prominent feature . Plus he wears glasses. And thats a thing that turns me on a hot guy wearing glasses.So why else would I end up fantasizing about him, diba? ; So... orgmate, if youre reading this, at least now you know why. Hope we can make my dream(s  come true. ; PS. If they do come true, make sure you have a condom on you. Salamat.  -G.U.Y. (Girl Under You , 20XX, Business Administration

Also, I wish I could have done better on both subjects, para naman pang-impress. Pero waley eh, di kaya ng powers.Why do I like you?

Also, never ko kayong nakitang nagtaray/nagsungit ng todo on both classes, at di nyo naman kami tinatakot come exam season/s. Overall, youre /truly/ a nice person.   Its sad to know na di ko na kayo nakikita sa Engineering. Nakita ko rin ata sa wall nyo one time na di na kayo nagtuturo sa Engg, so I guess thats farewell. Hopefully, makita ko ulit kayo someday.

Perhaps, this is the only way for me to let the world know...The relationship we had was the best that I could ever have in my lifetime. We barely knew each other back then, and to my surprise, we were already falling in love. Long story. Bottomline is, we cant be together.Thank you for helping me know myself better. For coping up with the supposedly-menstruation-period-temper every day. Thank you for making me dream of us getting married and having kids and spending weekends together at parks and movie houses. I wanna take you to concerts. I wanna cuddle with you on a cold Sunday afternoon. I wanna write you songs, and letters, and short sweet notes and post them on the refrigerator door.You are the most beautiful girl in the world for me, even if that means Im making myself less beautiful. You are the only person I want to wake up next to for the rest of my life. I will never get tired of kissing you good night, and I promise to do that first in all the mornings we will spend together. You are my every dream. Its sad that everything has to end.Im sorry for not being brave enough to fight for this. We know in ourselves that we can never be together. Its better to end it now than make it more difficult for us in the days to come. Just know that I will always love you, and you will always be my princess.Your Princess 2012 Business Administration

Related ito sa Academic Calendar Shift. Alam ko maraming mga concerns ang mga estudyante tungkol dito. Sana habang kayo ay may mga saloobin tungkol sa pagtutol sa Academic Calendar Shift ay isipin din ninyo ang mga long-term benefits ng pagkakaroon ng Academic Calendar Shift. Alam ko maraming factors ang PANSAMANTALANG maaapektuhan. Ngunit, isaisip natin na transition stage lamang ito. At pagkatapos ng transition stage na ito mag-aadapt na rin ang mga agencies, hospital, board/bar exams schedules (pati na rin ang NMAT and others -> you name it . May pakiramdam din naman sila. At kung ang concern ninyo ay magkakaroon kayo ng gap na apat na buwan na walang trabaho, ay mapagparaan naman siguro tayong mga isko at iska na makapaghanap ng trabaho. Kung sa ibang bansa nga ay hindi ikinakahiya na sila ay nagtatrabaho sa isang fastfood chain. O kaya mag-tutor at ipamahagi ang kaalaman natin bilang mga isko at iska. Iyun lamang. Sana mas maging bukas ang ating mga puso para sa pagbabago. - Pagbabago, kaya at pwede to,2011, NCPAG
Romar Jay Tirona aka Roj Tirona. You dont know how much you mean to me. The first time I saw your short movie Sparks I have never stopped thinking about you. I have seen the short a thousand times over and every time, I would click the pause button at the scene where you were staring back at your co-actor. And at that moment I would always imagine that Im the one you are staring at. Your eyes... Your eyes that could pierce even the hardest of barriers... Eyes that make me melt every single time...Our paths have crossed on campus a couple of times before. Shared casual stares. There was even one instance that you smiled back... Or so I thought, for the hopes that we shared a connection even for a brief moment... But then again, maybe its just me... It was such a rush when I saw you in the corridors of my college one day. You seemed to be waiting for somebody. I so wanted to make a move but I was too afraid to even approach you. So I just stared at you from a distance.Then T-Square came out. Oh how I wished that that was my story and that you were the guy with the T-Square. But I know that this is all just make believe because I know that we can never be together. I heard that you are already seeing somebody...So just allow me this chance to say how much I like you... And I hope someday, by some twisted act of fate, our paths meet and finally allow me to say everything to you in person...-confusedmusician, College of Music, 20**-*****

Sa AS ako unang natutong magjakol. One child lang ako kaya never akong nagkaroon ng time for myself to do such thing. Were somehow rich na din so every time that my parents are out, yaya naman ang nandyan for me. Its a good thing that my parents didnt choose DLSU over UP dahil baka never ko na naranasan ang pleasure ng ejaculation.Pero whats amazing, i learned it from my friend. He was the one who first stroke my private part and ayun. My first ejaculation was because of him. Handjob daw kung baga.

Sang-ayon ako sa calendar shift. Sang-ayon ako dahil kapag mas madali na ang exchange process natin sa mga ibang bansa - lalo na dito sa Asya - ma-eexpose tayo sa standards ng mga bansang ito, at makakabuti ito lalo na kapag  as maayos o mas epektibo sistema nila ng pagpapa-aral. Pag na-expose na tayo sa mga practice ng mga ibang pamantasan ay makukuha natin yung mga magagandang practice nila, at matututo naman tayo sa mga hindi ganoon kaganda na mga practice nila. Sabihin na nating the best tayo dito sa Pilipinas (variable to sa course, pero sabihin na tayong mayabang tayo at the best na tayo dito sa Pilipinas  hindi natin masasabi na the best tayo sa buong Southeast Asia. Hindi necessarily na gagaling tayo immediately after ng calendar shift, pero eventually, may makukuha rin tayo. May argument na andaming ibang problema sa Pilipinas na mas makabubuting pagtuunan ng pansin ng admin, pero ang marami sa mga problemang ito ay nag-uugat sa pinansyal na problema, at mas mahirap solusyonan ang mga ito, lalo na sa harap ng inevitable inflation na nangyayari sa lahat. (Yung academic freedom at free education ay dalawang magkaibang konsepto. At kung tutuusin, wala talagang free sa mundo, dahil ang nangyayari lang kapag ang isang bagay ay naging free ay nalilipat lang ang posisyon ng tagabayad sa produkto o serbisyo. Either way, may magbabayad dun at essentially hindi siya free.  Masosolusyonan natin ang mga problemang ito kapag naayos na natin ang ating sistema at pano tayo makakapag-ayos ng sistema gamit ang kaalaman na produkto lamang ng sistemang ito?Yun lang, kailangan ko lang sabihin yung rationalization kong yan. - Rationalist > Radicalist,2013, CMC

Stephanie Que Gaisano Dear Steph,I donﾒt know where you can read this or if you can ever read this, but just to be sure Iﾒm posting this both at your schoolﾒs TDF and my schoolﾒs AdMSF. First of all I want to say that I have never, ever before written a love confession letter to a girl. I havenﾒt even had a girlfriend before, well after all, Iﾒm still a teenager. And the ones I have liked back then I honestly have never said I love you to because I really didnﾒt feel that way about them. You and I know how young love goes, when you have a crush on a girl (or a boy for you , and you feel like youﾒre walking on air and life is wonderful. Then something happens and reality sets in, and you see that the person you thought was the best is far from it, and whatever you were feeling wasnﾒt the real thing. And thatﾒs why Iﾒm writing to you and confessing my love because we are not like that at all.I will always cherish that time when we met again after how many years at National Bookstore Katipunan, and how we actually talked to each other for an hour or so without really buying anything. That was, if I remember, right after you moved at Katipunan and starting living independently, a little bit away from your family. You were shy, but not afraid to talk to a boy like me, someone who might seem a little flirty because I always say whatﾒs on my mind. I knew then and there that you were different, and after that meeting I started keeping an eye on you. I didnﾒt mean I was stalking you or something, but I was attracted to you and I wanted to get to know you more as time goes by. I just knew that I didnﾒt want to rush in to anything with you, but that we might, as I was hoping, have something special in the future. Yes, I know you still liked him during that time, and I know him too, because he was my schoolmate at Xavier. You were right when you chose to set him free, not because he was not the right one for you, but because you saw how much he wanted to reach for his dreams. You were always a selfless girl. You freely give without asking anything in return, you fight for those closest to your heart even if it means that you could get hurt in the process. I know all of these, because I was there from the start. And I believe, since fifth grade, I was the one who loved you first.There, Iﾒve put it in writing, and I am so glad I have finally done it. Lately, we have been hanging out for just a short time, but I feel like itﾒs been almost like forever. We were never close way back then when I was a Xaverian and you were an ICAn, save for the occasional smiles and hellos and I didnﾒt bother even if I already had a huge crush on you. I know Iﾒm such a lame loser. But since I fell for you from the beginning, I have been carrying these feelings around without expressing them for much too long. I said that I am the kind of person who tries to be honest, and I am maybe a little too outspoken, but I was really careful with you. I have known that, given the chance, we could be together as lovers for a very long time, even throughout eternity. I will always remember that day when we saw each other at National Bookstore, when we rekindled our grade school friendship, catched up with each otherﾒs lives and that moment when you asked me to hang out some other time. I know I couldnﾒt say no. I vowed that this time, I shall tell you all that I feel for you since I was a skinny fifth grader.Now that we have spent some time with each other and have gotten to know each other better, I realize that I donﾒt want to lose you to any other boy. I want you all to myself, and I want you to know how I feel. Your closest batchmates from ICA (and your Xavier friends as well  said you currently like someone. I donﾒt know how to react to that. Do I still have a chance, Steph? I am taking all my chances by writing it here, Iﾒm sure you might read this somehow. But if you really like him, if youﾒre really in love with him, I have to, at least, let you know how I feel, and then we can go on with our lives. Iﾒm really not hoping that much. But who knows, if you might feel, or felt, the same thing about me, itﾒs your choice to tell me or not. If you donﾒt feel the same, then I will accept that too because I love you so much. I want you to be as happy as I think I can only be with you, so whatever happens after this confession, I can live with it. If you choose him, I just hope that he could give you more than the amount of love that I have for you. I hope he makes you smile every day. I hope he takes care of you. I hope he doesnﾒt make you cry, for a no boy is worth a girlﾒs tears. The only one who is worth her tears is the one who knows he could love her more than his life, but would never ever make her cry. I know this has come so many years late, but no matter what happens, I find solace in the fact that it was I who loved you first.I hope you remember who I am; signed with all my love and affection.I bleed Blue 1234 Im outside UP Diliman

TDF Admins, ang mysterious nyo po. Nakakaintriga! Gawa kayo please ng video or something na pasabog.MGA KA-TDF, DIBA GUYS? Grrrrr2013, Engineering
TDF sana mapost ito. Salamat!Isa sa mga pinangarap ko during my stay in UP is to form an org for car enthusiasts. Feeling ko kasi makakabuo ako ng org with people having the same interest as me - people into cars, car racing, car tuning, street races, Formula One, and similar stuff. Lalo pat may mga nakikita akong nagagwapuhang mga cars na nakaparada sa ibat-ibang parking lots around Diliman, especially sa AS at sa Arki. Haha yes, guys use the term gwapo to refer to astig cars. Pero ayun, nakagraduate akot lahat nang hindi natupad ang wish ko. Nakapag-organize ako ng ilang mga get-together para maplan ang pag-establish ng car enthusiasts org pero di kami nakakabuo ng more than 12 at hindi committed lahat. P.S. I am now using my fondness for cars in my career, as a design engineer for a well-known manufacturer here in Germany, while taking my masters in automotive engineering, and theres a car enthusiasts org here! Haha P.P.S. Im a few steps away from my being a Formula Three driver. Sana umabot ako sa F1. P.P.P.S. I just conquered the notorious Nurburgring-Nordschleife via a test drive. Its the longest, largest, and one of the worlds most dangerous race tracks. P.P.P.P.S. Please do spare a prayer for the recovery of my idol, Michael Schumacher. A word of advice Contrary to popular belief, Japanese cars are generally better, both aesthetically and performance-wise, compared to European and American models. If youre gonna do motorsports, forget Chevrolets and Chryslers. When properly tuned, Nissans GT-R series can make any Lamborghini eat dust. And it looks sleek too. But of course, I still love my SLS AMGs.- Hoping to be the first Pinoy Formula One champion,2004, Engg
Takot ang parents kong ilagay ako sa UP dahil sa pagiging liberal nito at baka daw masira ang Catholic faith ko. Madali daw kasi akong maimpluwensiyahan.Pero taliwas sa akala ng mga magulang ko, lalong tumibay ang aking Catholic faith. Dahil na rin siguro mga Jesuits ang kadalasang nagmimisa sa Holy Sacrifice. Minsan din sa Ateneo ako nagsisimba. Natutuwa kasi ako sa progressive-mindedness ng mga Jesuits. Tapos siyempre enjoy din ako makinig ng mga awitin ng Jesuit Music Ministry.Isa sa mga pinakafavorite kong magmisa si Fr. JBoy Gonzales, SJ. Magaling siyang maghomily. Hawig pa nya si Michael V.

The UAAP CDC Trophy is going HOME tomorrow.
The group went out for dinner. We then hanged out at a certain fun place nearby. After a couple of hours, we decided to call it a night.It was way past my curfew. You offered to let me spend the night at your place. Even though you were a girl and I was a guy, we did not find it awkward for we were close friends. You were comfortably lying on your bed. I was on the floor. You were in a relationship. I was heartbroken. We talked. After some time, you asked me to lie down beside you on your bed. There was silence at first. Few phrases were then exchanged, but the message was loud and clear.Lust overpowered us and we let our naked bodies do the talking for an hour. Exhausted, we fell asleep right after doing the deed. When morning came, we talked again and agreed to pretend that nothing ever happened the previous night. You guided me out of your neighborhood and I went home with a big un-wipeable smile on my face. -Mr. Fact Body, 20XX, Engg

There is this guy who likes me, and I like him too. But, there is this other guy who likes making out with me, and I like making out with him too.Cant help it. He makes me feel good.- greenlover,2013, Arts and Letters
Theres this girl in my dorm... Shes the coolest girl Ive ever met, and she has every quality I want in a girl. There are so many little things I notice about her that drive me crazy. Were close, and weve spent a lot of time together. We say that we love each other and joke about being together. Its funny because she has no idea how bad I want it to be real.Unfortunately, she spends a lot of time with another guy. I always see them together and it hurts a lot. The simple solution would be to tell her how I feel, but she is honestly one of my favorite people here in UP, and I dont want to risk such a valuable friendship.I think about her most of the day and Im sick of it. Im sick of not knowing what to do, loving a girl who only treats me like a friend and nothing more, and feeling like shit.-sdfnasfosd,2012, Engg
They say there will be two people you will love all your life the person youre gonna spend the rest of your life with... amd your greates love.Lucky those who found both in the same person. Unfortunately, Im not one of them.The first time I saw you, I knew you were going to be a really special person to me. You made my years in UP the best. But nothings better than knowing that the person youve fallen in love with fell for you too. Will you marry me? Do you remember this? I looked at you like you were a complete lunatic because it came out of nowhere. But you had that pang-asar smile on your face I really love that I had to say yes. It was a playful, cute joke but we knew it held a promise.But then we fell apart. No third parties, no one fell out of love. Just a misunderstanding that led to another, and another. It was the darkest time of my life. I should have done something but pride got the best of me, of us.I waited for you. That was the longest two years of my life. But I had to wake up. I decided to finally put you in this tiny little box and start to live again... without you.And then he found me a year after. He made me believe in love again. He was the best boyfriend any girl could ever ask for.Was. Because hes now my fianc�. I can never describe the way I felt hours ago as he asked me to be his wife. It was pure bliss and I couldnt be happier. But I didnt realize until now that I still have that one box with you in it. I know I love my fianc� so much and I promise to be the best wife I can be.To Mr. Engg, I have to let go now and seal that box. I know you already did years ago. I just want you to know that you will always be a huge part of me. After all, you are my greatest love.-RobinScherbatsky,2002, Architect
This incident left me smiling with emotions.I got to talk with a public high school student. Not a science high school, it was one of those lesser-known public high schools. I was kinda teaching him tips and lessons to guide him through his upcoming entrance examinations. First, of course, was the UPCAT. After which, we talked about the stark differences between high school and college life. And also what it was like to be a university student at UP. I got around to tell him that most students dont like to wear their IDs inside the campus, unless the guards ask for entrance to a building. Oftentimes, they keep it in their wallets, or in their bags. Only freshmen wear their IDs all the time, said almost everyone. Then, I showed him mine. It had that ID lace you buy at SC Maroons.He found it weird. And I asked why.He told me, mga students ng UP dapat sobrang proud na nag-aaral sila sa national university ng bansa! Ang laking honour kaya matanggap, lalo na mga seventy thousand daw nag-aapply? Tapos ang dami hindi pumapasa pa. Ako susuotin ko ID ko lagi kasi gusto ko ipakita na UP ang tatak, na ang swerte ko na may chance ako makapag-aral sa best university ng Pilipinas.Kung pumasa ako, he added as an afterthought.Papasa ka niyan, I told him, encouragingly.Ewan ko, sa school namin konti lang pumapasa. Kahit mga matatalino. Mga less than five lang ata sa last batch. Hindi ko alam kung bakit, ang hirap naman. Tapos Engineering pa gusto kong course talaga.I dont know if it was the quality of education in a common public high school. But his words moved me, and I smiled and I wanted him to pass the UPCAT so badly. It made me think how fortunate I am, and all the passers of the exam and currently studying in UP. Also what it means, to give back to the country. His attitude towards it was profound and inspiring, that it was something to marvel at and admire. I hope this kid studies hard and makes it. Im not that worried, though.Im not asking everyone to wear his/her ID all the time. But, I dont know, school pride can go a long way. Even if we dont show it by wearing IDs, I hope and believe that every student here has tons and tons of it to show though other means.So schoolmates, its a real honour to be scholars with each of you.Hey UP, here are the diamonds of your younger students.Keep your eye out on this one. ; Student Teacher,2013, Engineering
This is my first time writing here. Honestly, Im just bored and want something to do. I dont even know if this would count as a confession. Lol.Im nineteen. And I used to have a lot of girls. Not all of them were as beautiful as every guy dreams of but well, they were girls. I dont know why but I just enjoyed hearing all of them tell me how much they liked me. I loved the way it felt when I would wake up to a bunch of good mornings. Receive a lot of i miss you texts and all that shit. Even during my past relationships, I would spend my time looking for girls to flirt with whenever I could. Im not really sure. But I think its cause Im one of those guys who loves The chase.I was like that until this year.I met this girl when we were in fourth year high school. That was the only year that we were classmates but we became close. She even became one of my best friends. I would be there for her when shes down and shed be there for me. What she didnt know at that time was that I already had a thing for her. Something like  I would date her if I had the chance. But I guess she didnt notice since I was head over heels for another girl. We became so close that I was even the one helping her ex-boyfriend whenever they would have fights (and one of those times I did something ridiculous hahaha  Eventually, they broke up.Then there came the time when I felt like I really started to like her. I wanted her to be mine. I wanted to be the guy who tells her shes beautiful, the guy who she says goodnight to everyday and the guy who would take care of her. We were at our high school alma mater one day during the summer of 2013. We hung out the whole day. And that was the moment I decided to give it a chance. I told her that night to go out with me. Be my girlfriend for a day. Testing lang. So we went on a movie date. We watched two movies that day. The first one with my niece and the second one with just the two of us. It was kind of awkward at first but the mood eventually got lighter. After that date, I was sure of what I felt. I really did want to be with her. The very next day, I talked to her ex-boyfriend. I was close with the guy too. I asked for his blessing, being bros and all. And he obliged, saying he even saw it coming already. Everything else followed after that.Shes the first girl I actually took seriously that paid off. We spent all the time we could together after that date. And eventualy, we fell in love. I waited for her mom to come home for her birthday since she works abroad, and asked her if I could court her daughter. That was when I officially started courting her. And although its just the start of our relationship, being 4 months in. I could actually say Im really happy and in love with her. And I know I couldnt be happier with anyone else.The only confession out of this, I think, is me confessing my undying love for my girlfriend to all you TDF readers. And just a small suggestion to all those thinking twice about risking your friendship with your best friend, itll only be worth it if you give it your everything. Itd be better to regret how it didnt last as long as you wanted it to than to regret missing the chance of experiencing how it is to fall in love with your best friend.P.S. I know youre going to read this, B.   Being and avid reader of TDF and all. Just wanted to thank you for the memories weve had and the memories were about to make.- B,2012, CHK

To =>Hello there! Kamusta na? Its been a month na rin. I dont know why your name just suddenly went missing, whether you deleted it on purpose or not. Pero sana you gave me a hint that that midnight conversation was the last. You do know I always seek closure diba. It is saddens me because the thing you said about your leaving without any goodbye came true too soon. I really wanted to tell you so many things and I really thought youd be my bestfriend because we were open about everything. Maybe I am right that Im really not destined to have one as they all leave me. Sobrang hirap talaga maging clingy and mag-invest sa tao.I wish you the best in everything - academics, lovelife and family. Please extend my greetings to your pet, as I wont be able to see him anymore. Hindi na rin pala kita matuturuan ng lessons.I miss talking to you every single day. Always do good things ah, and in return Ill try my best to not get drunk and drink too much. So far, Im doing my promise well.Lastly, thank you very much! Talking to you was definitely a breather. You turned that simple days into something that I always look forward to everytime I wake up. I hope this isnt goodbye. I will wait for you.PS. If youve read this, paramdam ka naman. Comment anything that would get my attention (but dont give away my identity , create another TDF post, message the TDF admins or just show up na lang ulit dun sa chat.PPS.

To Francis Jose aka Mr. Face of a Winner,The first time I saw you I was like, oh my god whos this cutie patootie guy in our class?With your dark hazel brown eyes, puting pang-dyosa skin, basta with your looks, I easily fell in love with you at that very instance. Love at first sight perhaps as what they call it. Together with my fellow It girl friends, we stalked you a couple of time in your hangout place/tambayan in Econ and also in Facebook. And what a surprise, were bagay talaga. Were both kasi in Cutest Faces in UP, Awesome Faces in UP sort of Facebook pages plus plus plus we have been separately viral in the famous Overheard at UP Facebook group. You may not know me exactly now but whats more important is for you to know that I really fucking like you!!! Can I apply in your org? Can we have a selfie or even just a pubmat having us together that I think will be beneficial for our orgs? LOL!PS. Please please please accept my friend request na and also my friends!!

To my 4 best friends, Thank you for everythingKayo na kasama ko since first day natin sa U.P. even though di tayo magkakakilala at the start, we all became friends due to our common interests and common backgrounds.Kayo na sumusundo sakin kapag na lasing ako sa mga party.Kayo na tumulong sakin i-break yung smoking, drinking at womanizing ways ko.Kayo na tumulong i-convince yung parents ko na yung gf ko ay karadapat dapat para sakin kahit hindi affluent yung pamilya niya unlike sa mga pamilya ng ating posse.Kayo naging best men sa wedding ko.Kayo na nagstick with me through thick and thin. Unfortunately lilipat na kami ni misis sa England. Hinding hindi ko kayo malilimutan. Kayo ang nagbigay buhay sa college life ko. Promise babalik din kami one day at bibista ako dito palagi.

To the Lucky Girl,The moment I saw you at the tambayan, I knew you were someone special. With your sigsheet, you approached me and introduced yourself. I was pleased with your attitude and amazed by your effort to come up with such a sigsheet. Time passed by and my inactivity took me out of the loop, but I was very specific about keeping in touch with you and a few more of your co-apps. Our first conversations may have turned a bit awkward, but you remained friendly, nonetheless. By the time your (insert event here  came, I showed up on some days, anticipating your take on the task. You never failed to impress me and I gave you credit for your efforts. At some point, I think that I may have been a bit biased, but given my inactivity, I guess it didnt matter.You became a member the following semester, but you never changed a bit. If anything, I guess our conversations have become a bit more familiar and comfortable, from your acads down to random stuff. There were times that I was the first to get to the tambayan, waiting for my (our  first class. You got there a few minutes later, sat down and took a quick nap. Its cute, I admit, and I find it soothing.Im not (insert alias here  who plays with words to convey his messages.Im not (insert names here  who are always by your side.I never got to tell it to you straight. You have the aura of somebody who can make me smile no matter what the circumstances. Near or far, you have that simplistic beauty that I rarely see in others. I like you a lot. I really do. There, I said it. I guess Im just one lucky guy to have met someone like you.If youre reading this, there, I finally found the words to say it. yatagarasu41, 2011-***** Engg
To the boy I used to knowRemember that summer when we stayed after class near the main library and talked about anything and everything under the sun? It was when we got to know each other more; from being just classmates, we became good friends. Those afternoons were made even more picture perfect with the sun setting and everything being orange-hued, just like an old photograph.As the summer was about to end, things got complicated. We grew fond of each other at another level when you suddenly kissed me. Things were wonderful until you ended it abruptly without saying a word, and I was left broken and lost. I didnt know why youd lead me on like that, then leave me hanging.I wanted to know why, but its been so long that Ive given up on getting an answer. There are days when you still cross my mind and it makes me angry. But I cant seem to forget those summer afternoons we spent together in the orange hue; when things were simpler and we were just friends.However, I do not wish to be your friend anymore. You just broke me completely and I cant keep getting hurt. I do somehow wish you the best, and hope that you are happy with your girl. I hope you dont destroy her like how you destroyed me.To my friends who recognize this story, please dont name me. I just wanted to let this out- summersunsets,2009, Social Sciences and Philosophy

I always see you two driving around campus, shes driving though but you two always look happy together, very inlove. You two are really cute together and I hope you two last long, its really hard to see a strong couple in the University, most of them just look like theyre together cause of not so tying reasons.

To the girl na I thought from CMC pero non-major pala,Hindi naman ako galit/inis o kahit ano sayo. In fact, I like you on some level kasi talented ka. What you and my bf did when we were on a break was out of my control. Wala naman akong karapatan pakielaman yun. The only thing that bothers me is the fact that youve been telling people about it.Its well within your rights to share your experiences pero sana naman dont name drop kasi nasisira pangalan niya. He could never tell you this kaya ako nalang. Hes too nice and he really respects you, I believe he deserves the same from you.  Im not sure if youll ever get to read this but I do hope this message reaches you. This will be the only time Im ever going to try to talk to you and dont try to contact me either.

To the guy who I rode the taxi with at the day of the Lantern Parade, who and where are you?It was almost 1130 am and I was waiting at the waiting shed near SC for a Katipunan jeep. I dont know why, but for about 15 minutes already, none was passing by. Around 1145, a guy in blue polo shirt and white shorts approached me.Are you also waiting for a Katip jeep? He asked.We were both waiting for about the same amount of time already.Yeah, bakit ba walang dumadaan? Mamaya pa naman yung lantern ah. I answered.You wanna take a taxi na lang? Sa may Burgundy lang ako. Then lets split the fare. He said.Sure. But sorry, I didnt get your name. I asked.Sorry, Im Chri-something something-elo, Im from CMC. Im a nice guy ate, di kita pagsasamantalahan or something, I just need to meet a friend at Katip, and you seem to be in a hurry din kasi. But if you dont feel like it, I cant force you naman. He answered smilingly, extending his hand for a handshake gesture.GOD! IM SO STUPID! WHY DIDNT I HEAR YOUR NAME CLEARLY? Outside the UP Gate, the traffic was so heavy, and you called your friend thrice to reassure her that youre already on your way. You do seem like a nice guy. You were cracking jokes and telling stories at our almost 30-minute ride! You were easy to open up to. Also, you said we will split the fare, but you paid for everything! You were supposed to pay only 80 pesos, but you gave a 200-peso bill to the driver! You said its okay, that I dont have to worry about it. You left me at the taxi alone because you said you were just going to walk to Burgundy due to the heavy flow of vehicles. Nahihiya tuloy ako.

To the pretty chubby girl in the vet hospital na malapit sa CFAFirst time kitang nakita nung dinala ko yung aso namin sa vet hospital. Ayoko talagang pumunta pero pinilit ako ng mom ko since kailangan na magpabakuna nung aso namin. But, it turned out to be the best decision I made since I was able to see (and meet  you. Ikaw yung nag-attend sa dog ko and with that I found out you were a graduating student kasi kinorrect mo ko nung tinawag kitang Doc. I failed to know your name kasi you were not wearing a nameplate, nahiya din ako magtanong. You were so jolly and enthusiastic and I realized you really love what you are doing. You even asked me if you can take a picture of my dog, and I said yes thinking sana ikaw yung pwede kong picturan. Nung tapos na bakunahan yung aso ko, nagbabye ka pa samin. Ayoko pang umalis pero maoobvious na ko kung magsstay pa ko. Kaya dito ko na lang sasabihin. I have never met such a cute, pretty lady in whom I see so much passion for her work. Masama man, minsan gusto ko magkasakit yung aso ko para bumalik ako sa hospital na pinagiinternan mo. Sana makita kita ulit.PS. I hope I can find you in FB. Pero I dont know your name. All I know is you wear a maroon uniform and a pair of anchor-designed earrings. -LabradorOwner,2007, Engineering
To this girl that is out of my league,Truth is, I like you.You and the way you smile, which brightens up my day. The way your puppy dog eyes stare at me, brimming with enthusiasm, making me feel that the toil of every day work is every bit worth it. I sincerely apologize for teasing you every time I get the chance. I cant get enough of the way your sheepishly react and then try your cutest best to counter my argument. Nakakaadik.I want you to know that you have inspired me to live a better life. Despite being younger, it seems you have a better understanding of how things fall into place. I wish I can get to know you more. I wish I can be with you more. I wish I am able to show you my admiration, not just by writing an anonymous and vague open-letter-to-anyone, but by personally making you feel that you are special every single day. But our situation makes things difficult...Because I can teach you everything I know, but sadly, I cant teach you how to love me.- SirXoco, 200X, Engﾒg
To you my Engg friend...Youre one hell of a nice guy. Really. Youre the living epitome of a gentleman. From how youd stay in the danger zone as we walk in the open, open doors for me, take me out to dinner, pull out my chair and drive me home. At first, I thought that maybe you were just trying to look good, and probably hitting on me but its as if you dont even know youre this type of guy, youre doing it not because you feel like youre obliged to. I realized that when I got to know you better. Youre a gentleman, just because. I told you I like you, you didnt know what to say. I wondered why. And I thought, maybe you were still trying to weigh things - whether you feel like Im the girl you want to be in a relationship with or Im just the perfect best friend you can talk to and spend time with anytime you want. It even came to me that maybe there is another girl you consider as a prospect for a relationship, that maybe you compare her with me and if you realize that shes more perfect than me, youd finally choose to be with her. After all, what is your confusion all about, right?Yes, were still friends. Close friends, if I may add. I told myself Id wait for you. You know that the moment we became friends after all the revelations. But you know what I realized in the waiting? That Im not in love with you. That maybe I was just in love with the idea of having someone in my life to take care of me the way you do. Or worse, maybe I was in love with the idea of being in love, and you came at the perfect time. Its true that I like you. But I dont like, like you. I am not in love with you. Im sorry.Im afraid that if I tell you this, the kind of relationship we have right now wont stay the same. Soon enough, youll realize you want to be with me or you dont. You still give me most of your time, and I feel like youre into me but still not ready to jump in and take the fall. But right now, Im just not feeling you. Or maybe its a has-been already. Who knows? Maybe at a later time, the spark would reignite?-girlofyourdreamsnomore, 20**, CHE
Transferee ako from a university with a very high tuition feeDi talaga ako nakaabot sa cut-off ng UPD so napilitan akong mag-aral dun sa other university. Grabe talaga yung pang brainwash sa mga students nila. Pero matatag ako. Since grandparents ko at parents ko mga Isko at Iska at mas maganda ang FA sa UPD, gusto ko talagang lumipat. Maski yung mga cheer nila, di ko magawang icheer. Yung mga merchandise nia, di ako bumili (maski favorite color ko din yung school color nila. Ngayon at nakalipat na ako, I must say, sobrang saya ko, maski may issues and pagka-sawi, masaya pa rin ako. #ProudIsko    Yung CR lang nilang maganda ang namimiss ko ( Voltes V,2012, Fine Arts

Congrats.***#HaloEffect The Halo Effect is when attractive people are judged to be richer, smarter and kinder than their average-looking counterparts. While the characteristics do not always hold true, a good number of attractive people develop a sense of charm and confidence which amplifies said effect.A lot of psychopaths are actually very charming and attractive in real life. Excellent con artists, too, use their looks to get what they want. People wont suspect them easily, because their good looks shield them from prejudice.And the thing is, they blend extremely well with their environment. Exemplary citizens, crushes ng bayan, hiding their true colors behind this veil, careful not to let the monster inside show. The thrill is not in doing the act itself, but in not getting caught and outsmarting everyone else.  ***Ever since I was young, Ive always had a penchant for violence and aggression.

We met onlineYou were heartbroken from your previous relationship and looked for someone to talk to online. I happened to be bored and went online at the same time. Faith brought you too me. I comforted and gave you advice. Even if we only talked for an hour, it felt like ive known you for a long time. I felt something ive never felt before and instantly it hit me, if only I was not committed I would definitely love you the very best that I can. We exchanged numbers and you called me 6 hours after we met online. I liked you even more hearing your voice. I decided to end my commitment with first partner to go to you. As it turns out, my partner also feels that our situation doesnt really work so we ended it together. I called you and told you what happened. We decided we would meet the day you return from your vacation in the province. That day was the schedule of my HIV test. We texted and called the whole week then saturday came. You told me you would go with me because i was really scared of the outcome. You told me, no matter what happens, ill be there for you, positive man yan o negative. Waiting for the result was really nerve-racking but you were there, comforting me. The results came and showed that im negative. I was so happy and felt like I won the lottery because I wanna be the best for you despite my f*cked up past. I wanna spend my eternity with you because I love you. I dont care if they say that 1 week is short for a dating stage, in my heart I know I met my soulmate. I love you so much bebe and I promise to be a good boy for you.P.S. if you know me, dont tag me PLEASEHIV negative2010, Science
We were book-reading buddies. Nerdy, I know. It all started when you saw me reading a red book when I was waiting for the pre-advising line to budge during enrollment. Since then we would exchange books, you would share links on my Facebook wall about your favorite authors even though I wasnt really that interested in that genre at that time. We dont lend books to each other anymore, but I just wanted you to know how much it meant to me, how much you mean to me. Ive always loved reading, and I cherish connecting with someone through something I love--which honestly I rarely do. It somehow opens up the world, makes it a little brighter. I dont know.One time you wrote the cheesiest post on my Facebook wall for my birthday. I have my birthday hidden on Facebook so I was surprised you somehow knew. It really made my day. You said you bought me a book but I havent received it. Its been two years. And I cant believe Im still waiting.- Anne de Siecle, 200X, Fine Arts
We were classmates in a Math Subject. I was immediately attracted to you because not only were you beautiful, but your personality was as beautiful and as refreshing as the morning sunrise. Really, who wouldnt be? Of course, we became friends. You were friendly like that. Since you were having trouble with the material, you asked me to study with you. I complied. When we would study, sometimes with your sister too, you would sometimes tell me about your problems. You told me things you said you never told anyone else. Things like the issues you were having with your then on and off boyfriend. Things about your past. Things you want to do about your future. You didnt hold back any of the details. I listened. Listening to you talk so honestly was a refreshing experience. You bared your emotions in front of me. I still remember when we sat outside at 2 am talking about anything and everything, including our sex lives. In fact, I may have caught a line or two then talking about how we should try hooking up or try being together. Maybe I misheard, I dont know. But I played deaf and dumb for a reason. Secretly though, I entertained that thought in my mind.Of course you were a good listener too. I told you about a crush I had myself from another one of my classes. Youd listen to me as I would talk about her and the things we did. Youd hear me out as I complained about how some other boys were vying for her attention - and winning out against me at that. Youd tell me to keep going and not give up. And of course, I didnt. Good thing too, because I ended up being with her in the end.But I have to be honest with you now. I didnt tell you this, but I was scared back then. I was scared because I knew that I would have to choose eventually. I knew that by doing what you told me to do, I would lose you. And I did. I lost a friend. I broke the promise I made you when I said we would stay in contact no matter what.Then again, I understand your side of it. You told me about how you can never have children because of your condition. I told you that you should still take care because theres still a chance you might get pregnant. And you did. Now, you had another human being to take care of.As for me, I was simply too busy with my new relationship to make any time for you. And you probably understood me too, seeing as we sometimes saw each other with our significant others somewhere along the way.And so we moved on with our lives. You ended up staying with him (I think, or maybe not, I donﾒt know.  I ended up staying with her. I see the pictures of your beautiful child and Im happy for you. I would sometimes see you but I dont know if you ignore me because didnt recognize me or you did it on purpose. Either way, Im sorry it had to come to this. I didnt want things to end up this way.You may never get to read this, but I would like to let you know. Sometimes, I look back and wonder what would have happened with our lives if the two of us ended up together. I know it sounds like Im getting ahead of myself, parang ang yabang ko naman pakinggan, but I think that, even if for a short moment, you felt that way too.Please donﾒt get me wrong. Iﾒm happy with where I am now and I know youﾒre happy with where you are too. This isnﾒt a call for infidelity. Weﾒre both following our dreams and thatﾒs a great thing. This is just something that I felt I needed to do since, even if weﾒve both graduated, weﾒve left this memory behind. I just hope that with this confession, I can graduate from these thoughts too.Late Night Study Buddy,2010, Science

Weve been together for 2 years. Though wala namang formality, alam na natin yun. But like how other stories go, ours ended unexpectedly. We both gave up to the pain we felt and decided to close whatever it is that we started. It was really hard, actually. You were my first in almost everything.. First kiss, first guy to formally introduce to my family, first experience, etc. It was hard to let go when it felt like I almost gave you everything out of love.For the 2 years we shared, it took me 4 years to get over it. Other guys would try to knock at my doors but I would never allow them in unless they could prove to me that theyre better than you. Feel ko nun, walang makakapalit sayo sa buhay ko, sa puso ko. Im always waiting for the time when we would be together again. Emotional torture, it is.Fortunately, after 4 long years of holding on to the love we had, my heart gave up. Mukhang wala nang patutunguhan and so I concentrated with my life.Still, I want to thank you. For everything. You inspired me, motivated me, and brought out the best in me. Luckily, when I learned to move on and recovered from pain, someone appreciated me and brought back my worth. Just when I thought I would never fall in love the way I loved you before, someone came and proved to me that I can still be loved more than what I expected. Indeed, theres a rainbow after the rain.And to you, congratulations! I know youre doing well with your life. There are still times when I would stop and think of you. I just want you to know how happy and proud I am of you. Graduating with flying colors? Guess my sacrifice of leaving you and making you live the best of  your life paid off. Hoping someday we could still be friends. I miss you.- complicated,2009, Engineering
What have you done to me? You are a M.E. guy. Fresh. Cute. Modish. Pious. You were my classmate last semester. Im second year, you are a freshie. I have been stuck by you but you seem to be snobbish. But I was wrong. Really wrong. Because you are so kind and when one talks to you, I always see your smile and your face just brightens. So dazzling. From time to time, my feelings increase for you. I dont know if my feelings escalate quickly but you are so magnetic. I think this is the time that I want to fall in love again. You are just so perfect for me. You are an ideal boyfriend; youre gentleman, you have the looks, you have the porma, you have the brains, you look like you wont hurt any girl and you are God- fearing. I always think what if you will be my guy. I think I will be the happiest and luckiest girl ever. Youre so near yet so far...I was waiting for a moment that when I look at you, youre already staring. I was waiting for a moment that youll sit beside me and well talk random stuff. I was waiting for a moment that youll smile back at me when I smile at you. That moment when you are thinking of impossible situations but you are still hoping...Now, all these things are just imaginations. I dont see you anymore. Were not classmate. You are now so far. So heartbreaking. I still cant move on. I still have regrets that I should have approach you and be your friend. Even friendship would suffice. I just want to be with you everyday. Ill never get tired of you.Now, I am taking chances. Taking chances in nowhere. I know its impossible, but I have faith. If really we are destined, I know youll come. If not now, may be soon.  Ill wait for you. Youre not the only guy in UP but youre the only one for me. You know it hurts when you love someone but youre not loved n return. But what hurts more is when you you love someone but you never have the courage to tell him. (P.S. J, I miss you.- IdiedEverydayWatingForYou,2012, BA
When I first heard A Thousand Years, you were my first thought...Id smile, thinking about your smile. Every time it would play, Id think of you. That was my song. That was my song for you. It was what played in my head when I thought of you.Then, I found out that the you liked the song too.You asked me to sing it. You knew that I knew the words. You know I have a pleasant voice. I thought, Why not, this is no different from the other times wed sing together.But it was. It was your song too, I found out. It was my friends song too. You thought of each other when the song would play. Everyone knew, and everyone adored you both. I wanted to be happy for you. You were my friends. You both deserved to be happy.I wanted to be happy.Im contented knowing that I had a song for you. Im contented that I got to feel the way I did for you.Im happy to know that I could be in love.-Straight Guy Broke My Heart,2013, Home Economics8/1/2014 122941
When I was just a freshie sa college of Engg, i dated a law student from ADMU. He picked me up after class. Hes chinese and really clean-looking. Ako naman dugyot na isko. Yung look ko pa that time ay hindi maipaliwanag kung emo ba o hiphop, pero nagustuhan nya pa rin ako.He took me out on a date sa isang resto named A Taste of LA. First time kong makatikim ng hindi masyadong nakakabusog na pagkain na inabot ng P1500 for the two of us lang. When we had sex, he didnt complain about my inexperience. He would pick me up sa Philcoa, and he would take my hand while we drove around in his car. I felt loved, and I really liked him, and maybe even loved him, but I was too focused on our differences and it got the better of me.Being the immature guy that I was, I stopped communicating with him. He would try to talk to me, but Id just ignore him. One day, I lost my phone, and wala na talagang means for me to reconnect with him.I really regret not giving us a chance. It was so clear that he was a one of a kind guy, but I let him go. I guess its true that everything in hindsight is 20/20.To you, Mr. Ateneo Law Student (na probably ay lawyer na ngayon , thank you for making me feel very special, even for just a short while. I still think about you every now and then, even after allthose years. I really hope youre happy right now wherever you are. You deserve it. I hope you are making someone else happy as well.

With all the issues and controversy surrounding organizations and fraternities these days, I think its the right time for me to air this confession.I dont belong to any fraternity--but I always wanted to help found an exclusive and secret society. Something where the initiation does not involve violence... but a comprehensive test of wit, judgement, general knowledge, strength of character.. and the showcasing of the initiates unique abilities. I wanted to help establish something that deals with humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts, business, politics, international relations, environmental issues, technological innovation, the sciences and the arts. A society wherein the members keep abreast of many different issues that concern the world and the Philippines, where members discuss pressing issues in intimate private fora and go out to accomplish what needs to be accomplished when the need arises. This would include the utilization of contacts to lobby for the interests of the group in a greater setting, or the release of public statements regarding an issue, etc. as the potential is great. The ideal is elusive however, as the logistics of such an undertaking--to gather such unique and talented individuals into such a cause... is very difficult considering the multiple barriers of establishing something new and untested under the added element of secrecy, and I cant do it alone, sadly. My hope is that, someday, such an organization may exist and implement newer and better ways to directly or indirectly influence societal change not just in a university setting but may move nationwide and maybe even beyond that. The goal is the constant pursuit of advancement that is undaunted and unaffected by the threats of a conflicting majority, partisan politics, or those unwilling to accept change for the greater good in general. The only problem is... greater good may mean many different  things to many different people. Such a challenge is inevitable and substantial.In the end, I want it to succeed where others have failed in the name of true progress, and that may involve having to change some of the rules of the game as time moves forward.    -Identities are meaningless without character,1908, E pluribus unum
Years ago, I tried shoplifting at SM North for the heck of it.It was a medium-sized pink umbrella. I took it from the rack, carried it proudly and walked past the salespeople. I even stopped to ask the security guard at the department store entrance for directions, and he pointed the way to me with a smile.Im not saying you guys should try it, but if you wanted to, it helps to be well-dressed, good-looking and confident. I merely wanted to see if I can do it, and I found out I could, easily, so Im not going to do it again. Otherwise, wheres the fun in that?Next stop kill a mugger, or a rapist, or a murderer, with my own two hands. I want to see a lot of blood. Cant wait.  #HaloEffect #HappyNewYear Jack 20** Law

You meet all sorts of people in UP.Two summers ago, I encountered an interesting girl in Katag. I had just finished my baked mac and was about to leave for my class in Math when she approached me. She was tall, slim, and pretty. If I were bi, gay, or a straight guy, Id totally have the hots for her. I initially thought shed ask me to take a survey or something similar based on my experiences, but what she said caught me by surprise Hi. Do you have a pencil, preferably an old one?I said I did, and she then asked if she could buy it for twenty pesos. I didnt reply, but I searched for the crappiest pencil I had and gave it to her. She took it, handed me a twenty-peso bill, and smiled.Up to this day I wonder why she was willing to give so much for a pencil. Ate, if youre reading this, I hope my four-inch, eraser-less Mongol pencil was of good use to you. And thank you for the twenty. Nakapag-ice cream pa ako that day dahil sayo.

Youﾒre the guy every girl talks aboutﾗthe boy with the dimpled smile, the stud with the great body, the geek with the 1.1 or something GWA. Youﾒre nothing short of perfect and I hate you for that. Every time you talk to me, I always feel insecureﾗinsecure in a sense that you make me question myself if Iﾒm even worthy of your time. Im not the prettiest girl in campus nor am I the smartest and the sportiest, and on a subconscious level, I am aware of that. But somehow, when you give me your attention, itﾒs all that I can think of. When your flawless face turns to my direction, I remember that I have a pimple on my cheek. When you put your muscular arms to use, I remember that I just barely closed the zipper of my pants that morning. When you get an uno, I remember that I still havenﾒt gotten one ever. You make me feel small and youﾒre not even trying. Yet, despite the uncertainty that shrouds me when youﾒre nearby, I still feel happy. Whenever you sit beside me in class, whenever you call me in CASAA to sit in your table, whenever you offer your notes for me to copy, I become giddy. You make me feel like a Justin Bieber fangirl and I hate you even more for that. I know, that despite how much I pine for you, nothing will ever happen between us. Youﾒll never see me in the same light as those other girls you always introduce to me as your ﾓnew girlfriendﾔ because Iﾒm not like them. Iﾒm not your type. Iﾒm not good-looking, Iﾒm not smart and Iﾒm not athletic. Iﾒm not perfect. Iﾒm notﾅ you. Someday, Iﾒll probably get over you. Someday, Iﾒm going to distance myself from you and find new people to meet. But to be quite frank, I just donﾒt see myself doing that now. It sounds stupid, I know, butﾅ I just want you in my life. There are no other words to explain it. I want you even though all you give meﾗalbeit unknowinglyﾗis pain.-greenskittle,2011, CS

dear mr.newbie-prof-20**,whatever i did to you back then was a lapse of judgment on my part with a dash of alcohol. well, not exactly a dash but you get what i mean. i was giddy with the party drinks and im sorry i may have done a few things to you that night. my memory is hazy but i do remember flashes and i cringe at those flashes. but it was fun, at least for me.

freshman ako noon sa UP Law. day of orientation so it was the first time na mamimeet ko ang blockmates ko. our block was composed of around 40% UP undergrad, 40% ateneo, and 20% other schools (sorry super rough estimate . the organizers of the orientation gave out party packs of flat tops (which happens to be my favorite local chocolate  to pass around. my seatmate then was a dlsu-taft graduate. he was really gracious and friendly at first until it was my time to pass the pack of flat tops on to him. andami kong kinuha, siguro mga 15 tapos sumubo ako ng 3 pcs ng flat tops all at the same time habang pinapasa ko sa kanya ang pack ng flat tops. pinasa niya agad sa katabi niya yung pack at hindi siya kumuha. so habang puno ng flat tops ang bibig ko, i asked, o, bakit di ka kumuha? busog ka ba? hindi ka ba sweet-tooth? then he answered, ay ayoko kasi ng flat tops, pang-mahirap.

ﾓHi,ﾔ you said.Itﾒs funny how those two letters could suddenly brighten up your day (U and P also has the same effect huehue . The proper reply would have been ﾓhiﾔ, but instead I looked at both my sides and behind me, thinking that you were talking to someone else. I mean, to what would I owe the attention of someone as angelic as you? What did I ever do to deserve the gaze of those warm chocolate eyes? And why would that voice, not unlike that of Mozartﾒs best piece, be ever directed at me?You laughed. I liked the sound. ﾓIkaw, kuya.ﾔﾓOh. Uhhﾅhello!ﾔ I said.You laughed again. Could you please not stop? Haha. ﾓSaan po dito ang OUR?ﾔﾓAh, sakay ka lang ng Toki. Dadaan yun dun,ﾔ You furrowed your eyebrows. I must not have been the best at giving directions, haha. ﾓActually, papunta rin ako dun. Gusto mo sabay na lang tayo?ﾔWhat am I saying, I thought. Thereﾒs no way you wouldﾒve accepted that from someone as lame as me. But you surprised me by nodding and saying thank you, so I figured you must have had a very bad lame-dar. Haha.We had a little stretch of road to walk, so I asked you what you were gonna do there. You were gonna inquire about transferring, because your close friend from UP Baguio wants to study here. It turned out that you were actually from another school (Hint Snoop Dog , studying nursing. You asked for my course, I told you, and you said ﾓAno yun?ﾔTo quote my professor, I thought, Haay, magdedefine na naman ako. Haha. But I actually didnﾒt mind, since it just meant that I had an excuse to look at you.So holistic study of humans and all that shit. And the conversation went on from there, reaching to favorite TV shows (we both like Sherlock! , to favorite animals (cats vs dogs , to hopes and dreams for the future (you found out I was an activist, and you said ﾓCool!ﾔ . We had lunch, and afterwards I grabbed my guitar from the dorm and we sat under the trees of the Sunken Garden, serenading the afternoon.But all things must come to an end, and this is no exception. We exchanged numbers, promised to add each other on Facebook, and you asked me, ﾓIﾒll be seeing you again, wonﾒt I?ﾔ. I replied of course, of course. Haha. Novemberﾒs gonna be good after all, I thought.After that, not one day went past when we didnﾒt talk at night, sometimes we video chatted on skype, and basically went on getting to know each other. I gave you a tour of my school, and you gave me a tour of yours. You completed my day, you always gave me a smile, and you made me fall for you.One night, while we were skype-ing (if thatﾒs even a word, haha , we talked about love lives. You said you had a very big crush on this guy. You said that you think he likes you too, though you canﾒt be sure. But youﾒre really hoping that you end up together. I could almost see the longing in your eyes.ﾓOh! Who?ﾔ I asked. ﾓHeﾒs from UP!ﾔﾓReally?!ﾔ Dun dun duuuun. Is this what I think this is? Why are my hands getting all sweaty? Haha.ﾓManila, though.ﾔ �Well. Uhm� Uhh� Huh� There it was. What did I expect? That I�m her knight in shining armor? Oh, me. How could I have been so na�ve?To quote the same professor, ﾓWhat applies in math doesnﾒt apply in romance. You canﾒt assume that something exists!ﾔ Oh, sir. If only I listened. Haha.After that, not a day went past when you didnﾒt talk about that other guy. No matter how hard I forced myself to believe that youﾒll move on, it was obvious that you werenﾒt. I cut off all ties, and just disappeared. I couldnﾒt handle unrequited love. Not now, not during Christmas.Now, Iﾒm moving on (read trying but failing . Doctor Whoﾒs Christmas special drowned out the pain for a little while, but it comes back (Matt Smith, weﾒll miss you! . It always does. Sherlockﾒs coming back this New Year, so Iﾒm hoping it will drown out the pain, too. And HIMYMﾒs gonna end soon, so thatﾒs bound to be epic. Those things help in keeping you out of my mind, because itﾒs much better than the alternative of having thoughts of you, that once brought me joy, only bring me sorrow. Some of my close friends know. They ask me how Iﾒm doing, and of course I say that Iﾒm fine. I lie and say that youﾒre not on my mind (sound familiar? haha . But at the end of the day, Iﾒm forced to face the truth. No matter what I say, Iﾒm not over you. (lyrics by Gavin DeGraw - Used To Be The Hoper Of Far-flung Hopes,2012, CSSP

#UPFebFairMay mga nagtatanong na freshmen sakin, Masaya po ba ang Feb Fair? Eto po ang sagot ko sa inyo The word masaya is relative.Kung masaya ka kapag nakikipagsiksikan sa dagat ng tao na punong-puno ng mga estudyanteng jejemon na di naman taga-campus dahil open sa lahat ang fair, oo masaya. Kung masaya ka kapag wala ka nang mapwestuhan sa F-park kahit pagod ka na maglakad, oo masaya. Kung masaya ka kapag single ka on Valentines Day at di mo kilala ang katabi mo sa buwis-buhay na Ferris Wheel, oo masaya. Kung masaya ka kapag sakto lang allowance mo at wala ka namang mabili o magawa sa dinami-rami ng booths, oo masaya. Kung masaya ka kapag lahat ng mga kaibigan mo pwede nang gumagala habang ikaw kailangan pang mag-aral para sa exam sa STAT1 o gumagawa ng mga nakanamputang papers, oo masaya. Kung masaya ka na naririnig lahat ng mga kantang nakaka-bitter sa Razzmatazz, oo masaya. Kung masaya ka kapag nakikita mong lahat sila, walking by pair habang ikaw, forever alone, oo masaya. Kung masaya ka kahit yung pinapangarap mong makaka-holding hands mo at makakasamang humiga sa F-park para tumingin sa mga bituin pagdating ng fair e hanggang pangarap na lang, oo masaya. Kung masaya ka kapag kasama mo ang taong gusto mo pero di ka gusto, kung masaya kang hanggang tingin na lang at nagiisip kung hinihiling ba niya na sana yung ka-LDR niya yung kasama niya imbes na ikaw, oo masaya. Kung hindi, e di hindi para sayo ang Feb fair o Valentines Day sa Elbi. Wag ka nang makinig sa mga nagsasabing ipagpaliban mo muna ang acads para mag-enjoy. Mag-ipon ka na lang ng tulog. Tapusin mo requirements mo. Pilitin mong makahabol sa mga subjects na alanganin ka na. Sana nga yan na lang din ang ginawa ko last year.-HappyFeb, been-here-long-enough, CEM

#hipsteralertHay salamat po... I felt relieved upon arriving at UPLB that people will not judge you based on your music interests. Back in HS, people would diss me and poke fun at me just because I dont listen to Eminem, Rihanna, Beyonce, Miley Cyrus etc. My playlist consists of three sections light (includes Polly Scattergood, Noah and the Whale, Fritz and the Tantrums, Alt-J, Pigeon Detectives, Stars, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the like , medium (Muse, Jack White, Cage the Elephant, Mutemath, Gaslight Anthem, Amberlin, Walk the Moon, etc , and heavy (Within Temptation, Iced Earth, Tarja Turunen, The Renaissance, Amaranthe, We are the Fallen, Warbringer, Suicide Silence, Unparalleled Heights, Arch Enemy, Finntroll etc. I havent personally met people here in LB who share the same music tastes (even at least one of the sections of my playlist  but at least no one laughs at me when they ask me if I already heard the latest Rihanna or Beyonce song and Id respond with a no.BTW, I enjoy listening to LB-based bands as well, especially Ephrot Act and Pathway. P.S. I used to listen to NU107 when it was still on air. One of the DJs there was a UPLB graduate daw? P.S.II.

(Not really a confession but here goes.. LOVE LETTER TO NO ONENaniniwala ako at malakas pananalig ko na kapwa ko galing UPLB ang makakatuluyan ko. Bakit? Kasi iba ang mga tao dito. Magkaka-wavelength lahat at may pagka-weird. I like weird people because its something you cannot copy. Unique ang pagiging weird ng mga taga-UPLB. Kasi kahit na maraming katarantaduhan nang nagawa ang halos lahat ng kalalakihan dito, at least na-experience na nila at baka sakaling nakakuha na sila ng hinahanap nilang experiences mula dito at may kasama pang lesson to make them a man. (Id like to believe.  Dahil kapag pareho kayong taga-LB, maraming common grounds. Maraming pwedeng mapag-usapan at ma-reminisce na mga bagay-bagay. Dahil hindi ka nila itatratong damsel in distress kasi alam nilang strong tayong mga babaeng taga-LB at marami nang experience sa mga bagay-bagay.  Hindi nila tayo kayang i-opress. (Medyo feminist na view. HA HA At higit sa lahat, may certain appeal ang mga kalalakihan dito. Hindi man nabiyayaan ng gandang lalaki eh may ipambabato naman pagdating sa intellect and sense. Im not speaking for every one, opinyon lamang ito ng isang pangkaraniwang babae. Nakaalis na ko sa LB pero binabalik-balikan pa rin ito. Bukod sa pagbisita sa mga kakilala, iba pa rin yung nakakasalamuha ko ritong mga guys. They are easy to get along at iba ang flow of conversation with them. Siguro nga may friend/s akong lalaki na hinahanap ko talaga pag bumabalik ng LB. Siguro nga may wishful thinking din na baka sakaling may mabuong sparks. Pero sana talaga taga-LB ang susunod kong magiging boyfriend. Yung tipong kapag sabay na kami bumisita ng LB ay magtataka mga tao paano nabuo yung love story namin to think na hindi naman kami masyado nagkakasama nung college. Tipong magbibigay ng pag-asa yung love story namin sa mga namamag-asa pa na maisulat UPLB style din ang love story nila. Kaya ikaw na matagal ko nang hinihintay (3 years and counting , naway magkita na tayo at magkaroon ng lakas ng loob to take a risk na magpakilala sakin or vice versa, na mag-initiate na itext ako after ng ating meet-cute, na mag-aya na lumabas, at sana mag-blossom into something more. Promise di ka magiging under. Ipagluluto kita ng masasarap na food at pagaaralan ang recipe ng paborito mo. Mamahalin kita nang buo and unconditionally. Kaya magpakita ka na or magparamdam. Theres just something about men in UPLB. <3- Namamag-asa, CHE, 200*-*777*

Sumaya ako nung nagkakalabuan na kayo, kahit orgmates ko kayo pareho at ako yung parang tulay nyo, kasi *yey* chance ko na yun. Pero napagod rin ako kakaantay. Tapos naging kami na nung bf ko last year. Masaya naman kami, though madalas iniisip ko pa rin kung pano kaya kung naging tayo? Iniisip ko rin minsan na sana ikaw yung kayakap ko at katabing matulog.Tapos PUTANG INA TALAGA NG TADHANA! Nalaman ko nalang sa mga orgmates natin na may gusto ka rin pala sakin at nasaktan ka nung naging kami na nung boyfriend ko. Ngayon, di ko naman sya maiwan kasi ayokong mag away kayo.

Ako lang ba ang ganito?Hindi ko alam kung bakit, pero sobra akong na-aatract sa batok ng mga babae. As in, kung gusto kong i-judge (sorry for judging  ang ganda ng isang babae, una kong tinitingnan ang batok. Ideal para sa akin kung makinis, ang kutis sa batok, saka pantay ang shade of color mula batok hanggang sa may balikat. Gusto ko yung mukhang malambot halikan at plus points kung mukhang mabango ang batok hihi. Okay lang din sa akin kung morena, basta pantay ang kulay. Pero mas nagugustohan ko kung maputi ang batok, kaya may Batok Point Advantage sa akin ang mga chinita, kaya lahat ng crush ko chinita hihiWalang bearing para sa akin ang relative size ng boobs (although, plus points din kung malaki , ang mahalaga talaga ay batok para malaman ang degree of hotness ng babae (for me .- batoklover, CA, 2012-*****

CAS Freshie NightBeing a freshie then, I was excited to attend all those activities laid out for us, especially this one. My blockmates and I went straight to Baker Hall after our last class to catch this activity. All of us were giddy and expecting a blast from this even.And sure enough, we did.SJDC, Wyre, Salinggawi performed. So did other bands. But one band really caught my attention...Pathway.There was something different about them. Something about that drummer who was so hot. Something about that vocalist who was too sexy. Something about that bassist who was to adorable. Something about that guitarist who was too cute.But I guess my heart fell for the vocalist.After that, I started stalking him on facebook and learned a lot about him. I also keep on seeing him around campus which makes my heart skip a beat. One weekend, I saw him at Raymundo gate. I guess he was arranging something for UP Beat. I was really blushing when I saw him. I couldnt help but shout and laugh. After that, we walked to the Oblation grounds since we thought he would leave already. But his bike zoomed in front of us near CDC. Again, my heart fell. He looked so handsome and so dazzling. Creepy as it may seem, we followed him and it turns out that he was with their drummer for a photoshoot, I think. I was ecstatic to see him smile. I was really captivated by those eyes, that smile and that voice.I know that he has his special someone already. Im not looking for anything else besides inspiration.Juni Frio, thank you for inspiring me  -    crowned anonymous, CAS, 201*-****0

DISCLAIMER This story is quite long, hope you take time to give it a read. Thanks!Just very recently, I took advantage of my sleeping best friend whose girlfriend is also my best friend.Both of them are my long-time best friends and confidant who accepted me for who I am (Im gay . But I betrayed them. That night was actually unexpected, I was just having a sleepover with them as usual. I woke up late at night realizing that my girl best friend was gone. Suddenly, my guy best friend hugged me but I knew he was in a deep sleep. He thought I was his girl.My thoughts battled with me that time. Being single and lonely for quite a while, I really missed someone hugging me, being in that comforting state. There are times I hesitated pushing through this but unfortunately, I ultimately took advantage of him.I wont go into the details but we didnt go far from just fondling. It was already morning when he woke up and realized that it was not his girl hes sleeping beside with. I know that he knew that I did something to him. I just pretended to be asleep, so that he might think I also did not know what I was doing. In truth, I was well aware of all of it.When we all woke up, it was very awkward for me talking to the both of them. I wanted to get out there quickly! The girl does not have a clue of what happened. Then finally, the guy jokingly brought about what happened. I acted surprised and made an excuse of really not being aware of doing all those things. I lied to them in front of their faces, and its very hard. I cant bring myself to come clean.I tell them everything about me. They all knew how slutty and naughty I was, all my secrets. But I crossed the line this time. (Kumbaga, wala na pala akong pinipili sa kahalayan ko That was my lowest low. The night after the incident, I cried a lot, thinking about my big mistake. I was apprehensive of losing two of my bestest friends. This made me reflect on myself on how lowly of a person Ive been. I reflected on what kind of a friend I am, not just with them, but everyone. I realized that lust has taken a lot from me, and I must suck this poison out of my system.Now what I feared of has happened. I havent been talking to my best friends personally or by any other means for a few weeks now. Its sad but Ive accepted that. I deserved it.As a matter of fact, I dont want to see them too because Im still not ready to come clean and sincerely apologize. I still cant forgive myself, even if they forgive me. I kind of want to punish myself first before finally turning things around.I want to have a change within myself, have a change on my ways. I wanna be a better person, who is deserving to be best friends with the both of them.And while Im still in the process, I must have the courage to be alone, without my two confidant.Oo, parang kasama ako sa SMP ngayong Pasko pero alam kong kasama ko naman ang pamilya ko. Hindi man nila alam ang pinagdadaanan ko ngayon, alam kong mapapasaya nila ako kahit ano mang mangyari. Salamat din sa TEF chatroom people na nakapagpasaya din sa akin kahit papaano.Ive had my lowest low, so I think theres so way but UP! Screw SMP! All the single people out there, lets have an awesome time this Christmas by just thinking of the things that we have, which are all the things that really matter.Cheers for a better YOU this 2014!!-OptimisticRenaissanceGuy, 20**, CAS

Dear Math 14 recit instructor,Why do you have to be so smart and handsome at the same time? I have passed by your room more than once for consultation, which never pushed through, because I have always been overcome with fear, the kind in which I might not be able to control myself in order to make you mine. Though I am still struggling with my exers, I want you to know that because of you, Ive come to see Plane Trigonometry in a new light. I am trying my very best for you to be able to notice me so that I can get hold of you and your superior genes to be able to make a child wholl hopefully inherit your amazing math skills.-GeneticEngineer,CAS,2013
Dear Mr. KARL ANGELO CASTRO, Batch 2012, BSCE, CEAT,The first time I saw you was in our SOSC 3 lecture. You wearing a black muscle tee that showed off your perfectly sculpted arms. Seeing you that time was one of the most breathtaking and beautiful moments I have witnessed thus far in my life. Simply put, I think that you are one of the most physically attractive people that I have ever seen. After, I exhausted every means necessary for me to get your name without being too much of a stalker but all my efforts resulted to nothing. My attraction towards you never dissipated, though. One day, I was surprised when you added me on Facebook. Words cannot describe how much joy I felt. Number cannot quantify how glad I was. It was then when I found out what an incredibly pleasing person you are to talk to. Im not gonna go deeper into all the details because I am afraid that you might recognize me because we have been good friends since that day you added me on Facebook. I am writing this letter to convey to you, Mr. Karl Angelo Castro, that you are a wonderful person. You are intelligent, funny, witty, talented, lovable, amazing, perfect, and a whole lot more. I hope that one day, you find that one person who will love you and cherish you for who you are. You deserve to be happy. Just know that somewhere out there there will always be one person who will appreciate you no matter what, and that person is me. I will always be in the sidelines, secretly hoping and praying for your happiness. I really really hope that you read this. You take care always. Good luck.  Most sincerely,Enigma, CFNR,2011

Dear PressuredByExpectations,I would like to let you know that a lot of mothers are like that.As for advice, which you wanted, remember that these are variables you cant control - you cant control your mothers attitude, your familys attitudes, the fact that youre adopted. There are so many things in life that you cant control but WHAT IS IN YOUR CONTROL IS WHAT MATTERS THE MOST. You can control how you react to these variables. You can control your outlook in life and the decisions you make. You can decide not to let your mother turn your life upside-down.I think whats happening to you has happened to a lot of people and is still happening. It happened to me, but we learn and we grow stronger.Use your mother as an inspiration and a driving force.

You are into the arts, I was once into the arts. Feeling ko kasi isa kayong lihim na bukal sa Makiling at isa akong estrangerong nawawala. Uhaw na uhaw at nangangarap na kayoy matagpuan. Gustohin ko man kayong lapitan ay di ko magawa. Feeling ko kasi ay napapalibutan na kayo ng mga admirers at baka di nyo ako pansinin. Isang bukal na may mga tagabantay at nababalot ng salamangka. Kaya hanggang dito na lang po ang aking paghanga. Online na, naka-The Elbi Files pa.Yun lang po. Nais ko lang pong iparating sa inyo ang saloobin ko na somewhere under this sky, there is a person who is admiring you from afar.

Dearest Junco Balmeo,First of all, I have a huge crush on you. The first time I saw you was during our sophomore year. I was with a friend that day, we were sitting on front of the CDC building while, coincidentally, you were having your photography class just nearby. The first thing I noticed about you was your devilishly, alluring smile. It is one the few things that cheer me up whenever I feel crestfallen. Truly, I thank the universe for your existence. I dunno if youve ever noticed me, but just the fact that somebody as exceptionally captivating as you subsists in our University makes life a little more worth living. May life grace you with success and contentment.  Sincerely,stooge, CFNR,2011
Dito tayo nagkakilala sa UPLB through our org. Youre a year or two ahead. We were both in a relationship when I joined the org. I didnt like you before and I didnt know why.Dahil ka-batch ko yung girlfriend mo, I got to spend time with you kasi sumasama ka samin most of the time pag gumigimik kami. At yun I got to know you better and we started becoming close. We had a common interest kasi. Until halfway my stay in the org, nag-break kayo. Everyone wondered why, at ako yung isa sa kaunting taong nakaalam ng tunay na dahilan. Dahil may tiwala ka sakin. I became your confidante. Tapos, yun. Naging comfortable na tayo sa isat isa.You trusted me, I trusted you, and yun. We both knew we had something very special between us. Pero syempre, na-repress yun kasi nga hindi pwede. Im already taken. At mahal mo pa sya. Sobra. Pero, hindi pa rin natin naiwasang mabuo yung something special na yun eh! Though we didnt officially label it naman na may something talaga, we both knew. You told me nothing about it, and I told you nothing about it either. Basta, naging sweet lang tayo. Sweet-sweetan in public na pa-joke lang, pero alam naman nating somehow may meaning.For some time, we stopped communicating. Things became awkward. We were both like, ewan. Hindi natin alam pareho kung bakit biglang natigil yung pagiging close natin, yung regular conversations natin, sharings, and yung pangangamusta.But then just lately, napag-usapan naman natin kung anong nangyari. At yun. WHEW. Sobrang saya ko. Kasi na-confirm kong we felt the same way. Na kahit hindi tayo naging vocal noon, alam natin parehong we fell for each other. I dont wanna call it love, kasi hindi ko naman sigurado kung na-in love ba talaga ako. Mahal na mahal ko naman kasi yung boyfriend ko.Pero, I regret nothing. Im thankful na after that talk, pareho tayong nakahinga ng maluwag. Kasi, nalaman natin na pareho pala tayo ng iniisip, ng naramdaman tungkol sa mga bagay-bagay.Masaya ako sa nangyari sa atin. Masaya ako sa relationship natin ngayon. Maraming salamat dahil naging magkaibigan tayo. Sana mahanap mo na yung babaeng magmamahal sayo more than how your ex loved you, or kung magkakabalikan kayo ulit, sana hindi ka na nya pakawalan at mahalin ka nya lalo. Balitaan mo na lang ako. 3-- SweetSecrets, CAS, 2012-****

First semester, A.Y. 2012-2013. The start of the semester was one of the unfortunate registration period (to be exceeded by the following  Ive ever encountered during my stay in UPLB. During that time as well, I had a long time problem with one of my MST. As in my second year, I officially changed my MATH 1 to STS 10 but it did not reflect to my recommended courses until that time. So in order for me to enjoy the remainder of my days in UPLB, I pursued again to change my MATH 1 to STS 10. During the morning of the first assisted enlistment, I decided to have my GE changed (again  together with two other majors. I was confident enough to get the STS 10 since my adviser down to division head doesnt ask too much questions, as well as the free slots are looking fine. I gathered all required signatures and passed it to the college secretary before lunch, thinking everything will be sailing smoothly at that time. I was wrong.Come lunch time, when SystemOne got back online, I was able to view classes and schedules. To my horror, all slots in STS 10 were already gone. My friends told me that I could use my graduating powers during prerog but it never occurred to me to prerog in a GE class. That moment, I had another plan in mind.When I got my approved change of subjects, I erased the STS 10 using liquid paper, photocopied it, wrote down the one MST I looked up with free slots, and photocopied it again. I went straight to the assisted enlistment area. and showed my approved-revised changed of subjects, and got in to that class. Finalized and registered some other time. No prerogs, no hassle. However, I think it was karma that struck me following that semester. First, I got low grade from the GE I replaced with my MATH 1 and STS 10. Grading scheme was a bit higher and it might be the teacher who gave low grades (with almost a quarter from his two class were initially exempted from his finals . Second, while filing my candidacy for graduation, one of the assistants from the college secretary called to my attention. She said I had a deficiency, which turned out to be the change of plan from STS 10 to the another MST. She asked me if I did submit a form. Without saying anything, she smirked and asked me to arrange the necessary documents to make the change in GE official. I was lucky enough that it was the only thing to do, rather than not graduating due to a GE not credited due to lack of official document. I was relieved, but I knew that smirk she gave me meant that she knew what I really did.  -- Dovahkiin, CAS, 2009-****
First time ko magpapasko dito sa Elbi. First time na malayo sa family ko. This will also commemorate the 4th year na wala akong jowa. It was also a day before Christmas when we broke up few years ago. Nahuli ko kasi ang hinayupak na may dalang kalandian sa apartment. At nakita ko lahat ng ginawa nila. The nerve talaga.  Pero sa tinagatal tagal ay naka move forward na ako siyempre.  Its just that during this season of the year ay parang may flashback. Lahat ng sweet and bitter memories bumabalik lalo na at mag isa lang ako dito ngayon. Friends and housemates went on vacation. Wala akong choice at madami akong papers na inaayos. Loneliness knows me by name. Sa lahat ng mga magpapasko ng mag isa dito sa Elbi, tuloy pa din ang buhay. Maligayang Pasko!-Lonely Lulu, 201*, CEM (di tunay na college

Good morning. Sa mga walang pasok mamayang 12-5, attend na kayo  
Graduating ako nun. Ang saya ko! LAst sem ko na sa eLbi. Approved na outline ko tapos manuscript na lang. Konti lang din subjects ko kaya feel na feel ko na mag-march!Ok sana ang lahat. Good academic standing, good friends and of course, I have a good boyfriend. What more could I ask for?Then suddenly, eto na. Something came up. Delayed ako. Sobrang kabado ako. Di ako alam gagawin that time. What if buntis nga ako? Paano ko to sasabihin sa amin? Ano na lang ang sasabihin sa akin ng parents ko? Ng ibang tao? Hindi ko kaya un!!I told my guy about the situation. Biglang naging cold un treatment niya sa akin. Kaya super paranoid ako lalo. Then he asked me kung gusto ko daw ituloy. Pero sa tono ng pananalita niya, alam ko na siya mismo, ayaw niya ituloy un dinadala ko. Then there was silence... I decided to give up. feeling ko that time, hindi ko kaya maging isang ina. Tapos nalalaman mo pa na ung guy mismo ang unang mag-give up sayo.He was there when I was starting to do things para mawala un dinadala ko. Then mga ilang weeks lang, nawala siya na parang bula. I was left with no choice. Hindi ko alam ang gagawin ko. Kapit-patalim na talaga ako. I did everything para mawala siya. Abortion pills, abortifacient foods, lahat na! Sa wakas, I got rid of both of them.Alam ko, isa ito sa mga selfish acts na nagawa ko sa buhay ko. Pero wala akong pinagsisihan sa lahat. Masaya ako ngayon. I have a wonderful career. Lahat ng gusto ko, meron ako. Name it, I have it all.Peace of mind? Oh please.. Isa kang multo na patuloy akong binabalikan magpasa-hanggang ngayon!cytotec, CAS, 200*

Hello The Elbi Files. This is not a confession but an observation and a question.Most of your posts are about broken and unrequited love. We all have a dose of those right? So then what is the point of this page? Kasi, this page should have a positive effect to UPLB Students like instead of ranting you should take action.The Elbi Files takes advantage of the passivity of the students.

Hello UPLB, this is Sarah. Ive seen that all of you failed to discover the hidden treasure. As a final message to all, let me say congratulations to the ones that have made it thus far.I can say that those two are the Sherlock and Watson of UPLB. I cannot agree more, however their intuition, wit and knowledge wasnt enough to decipher Clue 13. I am really sorry, you couldve seen me as I was running away from the two of you in Demarses. The treasure was covered too much with metaphor when it was just P3000.00. I hid it somewhere in the final destination CEAT Library. But now, its with me.Well, thats just the way it is. However, the journey wouldnt end with that 3,000.00. There was a note attached to that 3000.00 and it would lead you to that hill behind EE.It was supposed to be a reward for something even greater. But now, I think no one with that much intellectual prowess could guide me to that journey.Ill see you soon, everybody. Not all pictures are good... for e- Sarah

Hi, Bianca Guillana nagpopost lang ako dito para ma-feel mong loved ka kasi important ka sakin <3-Chepar, CAS,2013
Hi. I just want to vent this out.I happen to be one of those girls who had suffered from how-your-boyfriend-should-be-stereotype.When I say that, I mean someone who will treat her girl like a princess; will shower her with gifts; will surprise her with flowers, chocolates and teddy bears; will serenade her in front of a crowd; and the likes. See? Very pocketbookish.I, too (I assume it is not only me , became a hopeless romantic person. I love the idea of falling in love. I got my heart broken too but it did not stop me from believing that someday the right guy for me would show up.And he did. Yes, as you would expect, hes not like the guy from pocketbooks and Nicholas Sparks novels. He isnt sweet. No gifts during birthdays. No flowers on Valentines (I must say, I still havent received any flowers from him at all . No extra something on anniversary.As shallow as I am, I have cried at those times. Especially on Valentines Day wherein I have been expecting for at least a flower from him because we were surrounded by couples at that time. I have witnessed guys giving flowers to their girls for how many times. But I have received nothing.I have been honest with him about this. Ive told him that I have the dilemma of wanting something so much that I dont really need. I have emphasized that hindi ko kailangan, pero gusto ko sanang maranasan.He was sorry. Sincerely sorry. I knew hes not that kind of guy. And I have accepted that. He loves me more than anyone else could. Hindi nya naman ginusto na walang mga extras kasi 1  hindi pa nya alam ang mga ganun, and 2  tight sa budget.So, dahil mahal ko talaga sya, even though naiinggit ako minsan sa ibang girls, I have learned how to be contented with the kind of love he gives me. Hes sweet in his own way and he showers me with love in every single second of every day. I love him, kaya kahit ako na lagi ang nanlilibre sa kanya, okay lang. HAHA. Kapag may work na sya, he promised me naman na babawi sya.  I think love really makes you believe on what you dont believe before you fall in love. It will make you realize that Hey, thank you God! You gave me someone whos not I was wishing for but someone whos more than I could pray for.Thanks for reading!Spread love <3Happy Holidays everyone!Let It Snow, CEAT,2008

Hindi ko alam kung ako lang.Sobrang mahilig ako sa kamay. Kapag may nagustuhan akong tao at kung may pagkakataon, ichecheck ko muna ang kamay niya. Yung hugis at kung malinis ba ang kuko.

I JUST HAVENT MET YOU YET - Michael BubleExploited. Push. I dont know which is which.I met you at a party. Well I did not really meet you, rather, I saw you.You were standing at the entrance of ICs. You were talking with someone. You smiled at me as I was approaching the door beside you. You were wearing a faded polo, shorts and boots. Youre so beautiful. Really beautiful.I asked my friend if he knows you and said you were familiar. But I did not succeed to know your name.I sat upstairs because I saw the name of our organization there.I was hoping to see you again. I know I would see you again.Hours passed but I havent seen even a glimpse of you.Then you passed by, this time you were just wearing a black top. You removed your faded polo. Nainitan ka siguro? God youre just so hot. I could now see your sexy neck. Why on earth are you like that.I wanted to approach you but as I was so shy. I dont know. I just wanted to know your name. I wanted to sit with you. I wanted to know you. My friends are asking if we could go home already because we have a 7am exam and we havent started reviewing yet. Bloodyhell right? But I just wanted to stay where I was. I wanted to see you more. I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to get your number. But I was just too shy.I just then saw you on the dance floor. You danced really good. Really really good. I watched you the whole time. I noticed you were having a good time. I wanted to approach you but then again I was shy.I talked to an orgmate and told him about you. Kilala ka daw nya. And I said, Putsa! Talaga? Eh kanina ko pa sinusundan yan ng tingin tangina pare tinamaan ata ako sa kanya.He said your name is Mitch. That was all the I got from him. He was really drunk when we were talking maybe thats why I havent exhausted any information from him.Nakauwi akong hindi kita nakakausap. Pinalagpas ko ang pagkakataong makilala ang isang tulad mo. Pero naniniwala akong hindi pa huli ang lahat.So if youre reading this, Hi Mitch.I am really having a hard time to look on you on Facebook kaya rin naisipan kong sumulat dito. Isang panawagan ba?

I NEED AN ADVICE. >.<I am so fucked up.I messed up everything I had with my parents. I ruined their trust, lost their respect towards me and made them so frustrated to the point that they think they failed to becoming good parents. I am an adopted kid. My parents are both professionals and they have a very successful life except for having their own child thats why they adopted me. When I figured out I was adopted, I was shocked and everything around me changed. The way I see things. My perspective to the way people act around me. People like my parents, my cousins, and my other relatives. At first, their actions were tolerable and I still see fairness to me and my cousins. My aunts and uncles were very good to me and they always say theyre always proud of me. But to my mother, Im a piece of work. I am a very outgoing child and she thinks I never ever followed anything that she wanted. My mother was the trickiest mother in the whole world. I dont know what she really mean when she say things like when shes commanding me to mag-aral ka lang! Dapat magfocus ka sa science. She always tells me that sentence whenever I find a new hobby(photography, guitar-playing, photoshop editting, skateboarding, etc . Now, I dont have anything in my hobbies left. Everything I love to do...all gone. All popped like a bubble, because my mother said so. But, in several occasions, she would make me the photographer,or musician of a certain event and she would say jan ka naman magaling e. How could I be magaling in some things if youre hindering me in doing my interests?!Thats when I saw the unfairness of my mother to me and my cousins. All of my cousins work, shed say theyre wonderful and very cool or very good. But me? Never. She never said anything like that to me. She never appreciated me. She never lets me do anything I wanted. I WANTED. Shes the one whos always right. I never had my own decisions and I have never practiced anything I wanted. Shes forcing me to do SCIENCE but when I do, she wants me to do ONLY it. Fuck right? Yes you may say Im rebellious but, I dont know what to think right now. I dont even know what is right anymore asserting myself to them, or letting them run my life.This rebellious act came to a very bad consequence. I kept myself away from science for 5 months and thats when my parents concluded that they are failures. They told me how frustrated they were when I left school for a sem and my mom told me that that time was her most frustrating moment. Currently, I am full of negativity and out of balance of my life. I want to shut myself out of this world right now. I dont know any psychiatrists and my parents doesnt know these feelings Ive been having. I need advise from open minded people...because mines starting to close. -_-PressuredByExpectations,2011, CAS

I cant believe that my wildest sexual fantasy would ever be fulfilled.It was a Wednesday and we were both doing grunt work for a class we had together. Her and I have had sex before, but it was strictly in my room, on my bed (or on the floor, it depends on the position . Out of boredom, shed shot me a few glances that lingered for a few moments. Obviously, we were no longer interested in doing acads.  It first started when she asked me if she could hit me with her pillow. Being the patient guy that I am, I said, yeah, sure. And of course, she did, but with those soft hits, she followed up with a sweet, simple kiss.But of course, I wasnt content. I closed my eyes and kissed her again. And again. And again.  I added my tongue into the mix.  I kissed her again.  Our tongues wrestled for control.  She bit my lip and I moaned as her teeth clamped on my lower lip.  She knew which buttons to press, I swear.  My member was trying to get out of my shorts.  I wanted--no, I needed it. I didnt care where we were going to do it. But for the sake of my sleeping roommates, I asked if we could do the deed in the bathroom.  But she had an even better idea.Fuck me outside.Im not going to extend the story.  I banged her long and hard on the front porch of my boarding house, in the open air.  Good thing we were able to do it long enough before my roomie walked outside to take a smoke.  Muntik na kaming mahuli, but I have this weird feeling na even if he had walked in on us in the middle of the act, I wouldnt have cared.Masyado kasing masarap.- Writurrr, CAS, 2011-*****, BA Communication Arts

I know im exaggerating a bit but thats how I saw her. Hindi ko pa siya kilala noon kaya nagpatuloy na lang ako sa paglalakad. After that, lagi ko na siyang nakikita everytime na dumadaan ako sa OPark. Yung smile niya na mapapangiti ka din kahit na kakatapos lang ng sobrang hirap na subject. Haaaaaaaay. I hope i could meet this lady.     Then isang araw habang nasa tapat ako ng laptop ko, I was so bored na tinignan ko na lang ang mga tao sa friends list ko sa facebook. I was surprised na itong girl na nakikita ko lang sa OPark ay friend ko na pala sa facebook. I was so happy that time. Gusto ko siyang imessage but I didnt do it dahil kahit sa facebook may pagkamahiyain ako. Lumakas lang yung loob kong ichat siya when i saw her online at 12 in the morning  I almost forgot...

I dont even know if you would get to read this.I guess Ill start on the day I first saw you. It was a sunny afternoon, at the CEAT steps, just before our ENG 2 exam. You were wearing a pink bonnet, and a gray and black 3/4. Of course, you didnt notice me sitting on the other end of the steps; you were deeply immersed in reviewing for the exam. I dont really know why, but I instantly grabbed my pen and paper, and started drawing you. Maybe it was because of your beautifully curled hair, or how you whisper the words from your notes with your lovely lips. Afterwards, I asked my friend to give the sketch to you, cause I was a little shy to give it personally. I never got to know your name that day; I was satisfied with the thought that you appreciated my drawing of you.Days passed and U still couldnﾒt find it in me to say ﾑhelloﾒ to you. One day, I received a text message from a friend, asking if I ever did a sketch of a girl a few days back. Figuring heﾒs a common friend of ours, I said it was me. Then, I finally knew your name, your number, course, and the next thing I knew, we were text messaging each other. You said you really appreciated my sketch of you, and I was so thrilled that you felt that way.The first time we ever got to talk was at my brotherﾒs quizcon, you were in your PE uniform, with a skull candy headphone. I have to admit, you looked kinda hot back then. Then we started to spend some time together, have dinner together, do our LRP together, and all throughout I was so happy that I got to be with you. Youre so fascinating, the way you walk, the way you talk like an angelﾒs song, the way you run your fingers through your bangs, how you talk about your life of daring adventures, how your lips gently say my name makes me so weak, how your eyes feels like Ive been missing a lot in life and Ive found it in you. And I guess it was pretty obvious that Ive fallen for you, and I realized it from that night when we were lying down together at Freedom Park, stargazing. I looked to my left, and I saw you, I felt completeness, I felt like theres nothing else to be afraid of, other than being away from you, I felt like theres no one else in the world that I should be looking for.Feb fair came, and I already reserved roses for you days before Feb 14. Ill never forget that Valentineﾒs night, how your face glowed when I saw you by the Archers shooting range, it was a real heart-stopper. Everything moved in slow motion, as I approach you, whom I felt was the most beautiful girl ever, wearing a simple white shirt and maroon pants. Your soft gentle hands were so comforting when you accompanied me on the Ferris wheel. If I ever have one wish now, Id wish I could stay in your arms, like the way you embraced me that night, for the rest of my days. But it wasnﾒt al happiness with you. The truth was you still hadnﾒt move on with your ex boyfriend back then, and it was sad to think that you felt guilty when you were with me. I mean, seeing you teary-eyed and drowned in thoughts of him break me inside, like a knife through the chest, and thereﾒs nothing I could do about it. All I wanted for you is for you to have the happiness that you deserve, but how could I give you such when you are reminded of him when weﾒre alone. So you decided to end it, with a midnight poem, saying everything was happening too fast. And that was that last that I have heard of you. We never saw each other since.I guess some things are really never meant to be. Everyone says that I should forget about you, saying; ﾓDre, maghanap ka na lang ng ibaﾔ, ﾓSix letters two words Move on.ﾔ, ﾓﾒdun ka na lang sa i-rereciprocate ang feelings mo.ﾔ. Maybe theyﾒre right. Maybe I should just forget about it. But how could I, when my feelings for you havenﾒt change, then until now. I know itﾒs crazy, but Iﾒm still in love with you, and not a day goes by that I never thought of you. You changed a lot in me.But it doesnﾒt matter anyway, youﾒve probably forgotten all about it, and maybe you already have someone else. I guess everything you said were just words. Thereﾒs no point in remembering anyway. So why am I writing this? Donﾒt really know either; Iﾒm not hoping anything to gain.Although, I am still holding on to the last lines of that letter you gave me.(I know itﾒs not the prettiest portrait of you, maybe the next one will be better. - ST, CA, 2012-*****
I dont know about you guys, but for me first dates are always nerve-wracking -- lalo na kapag gusto mo yung taong ide-date mo for the first time. Ni hindi ko nga alam kung paano nagagawa ng ibang tao na lunukin yung pagkain nila habang nagkukunwaring chill lang sa harap ng isang taong nagpapakabog ng dibdib nila. Pero heto na eh; napasubo na ako. And for our first date, dinala nya ako sa The Spice Jar Food Hub, isang Tex-Mex restaurant sa may F.O. Ewan ko ba pero sa tinagal-tagal ko sa Elbi, never akong nakapasok dun. Oh well, first date, strange new resto. Urgh. What could be worse?We sat down and waited for the meal. Okay yung ambience ng place -- nakaka-relax. At nung dumating yung order naming Ginger Garlic Chicken, nakalimutan ko lahat ng nerbiyos ko sa sarap nung pagkain. As in wow! How could have I not discovered this place sooner?! At surprisingly, sobrang nag-eenjoy na ako. Nagku-kwentuhan at nagtatawanan na rin kami ng ka-date ko. Ang saya. Ang... Hehe. <3A few weeks later, naging kami officially ng ka-date ko. A few months ago, we celebrated our first anniversary. Paborito pa rin naming kumain sa The Spice Jar from time to time, and every time we do, I feel like Im floating. Our fond memories started here eh, so this place will always hold a special place in my heart.Thanks, Spice Jar! ~Vi, CAS, 20**-*****
I dont know whats with me but I guess I am a magnet.Simula nung medyo naging proud na ako sa kulay ng bandera ko, madami nang lumapit sa akin. Sa totoo lang, I am not the kind of gay that wants to group myself with the people who are like me. I am more of a discreet one and I guess I will be for the rest of my life. You can see me roam around the campus looking like a straight guy but many know that I am not.Ang pangit naman dito, naging lapitin ako ng mga katulad ko pero may gusto ko parin ako sa babae. Katunayan, I am a bisexual and my former girlfriends know that I am one. They didnt mind. Ako lang yung talagang nakipagbreak kasi feeling ko hindi ko naibibigay yung mga gusto nila sa isang boyfriend. Una dun ay ang security, malambot ako oo. Back to the confession, dahil dun nga, ang daming lumalapit sa akin para magparamdam or manligaw from CAS, CVM, CEM, CHE, CEAT, CDC pati nga sa GS meron din. I dont know what is with me na kagusto-gusto e sa katunayan, I am a jerk. Ngayon ko lang ito naramdaman, ang maging ligawin ng mga kapwa mo. Sabi nung friends ko, I should take it as a compliment kasi naappreciate din nila ang appeal ko. Nakakatakot lang din kasi minsan mga professors na lumalapit sa akin para makipag-kape, pumunta sa Calamba para manuod daw ng Frozen o kaya mag-usap lang daw. Sorry po, hindi po ako fan ng mga ganito. Mas gusto ko na dumating yung taong para sa akin ng walang force na nag-interfere kung di law of attraction lamang. Saka, ayoko po talaga.Madami ding gusto lang matikman ako. Di ko alam kung bakit / Hindi ako gwapo.Sorry po sa mga umaasa parin. Pero may gusto po ako talagang iba.

I dont know when or how it began. I myself couldnt even say how my feelings for you...from a brother, a friend, suddenly changed. How our closeness became this. What I know is that, Im in like with you. I dont know if its love, for I have never felt it before. Everythings new to me. I like you, and I know I shouldnt but I do. Im sorry.When I first met you, you were in a relationship. We became friends, close friends...and I was happy, contented with that. I have no idea whether you felt something more. I dont know if those words, teasing, touch have meaning. Im sorry that I was always coming to you for help, for company... I really thought of you as a friend. But it didnt took me too long to realize that Ive  fallen in like with you, that Ive fallen too deep.You finally broke up with her...but why, why oh why does the universe doesnt get the timing right? I was seeing someone...not that I like him like I like you, but he became important to me too. Until the time came that were both free. I had to believe that you had moved on from your ex when she came back. You said that youre not ready, not interested in a relationship. Is it that you are not interested in a relationship? Or simply, that you are not interested in a relationship with me?I was hoping, wishing that wed end up happily, that wed see each other again and everything would just be...if not perfect, but right. That it would be the right time for the two of us. That maybe, the feelings wed had once were truer than ever. But these stories doesnt happen in real life.I dont want to wait anymore, this fantasys never coming true. This aint Storybrooke. I cant keep on holding on to every moment we had together. Thinking of your faults, my faults...our faults why everything happened. I want to be happy, and if possible...be happy with you. If we can finally be happy togher, then let us please be happy together. But if it means letting go, then Ill do the honor.But with everything, friend...brother...Im sorry that during our nice, cool friendship, I had to battle with my unrequited feelings and bad timings...that I think Im in like with you.Fuck you.-K.E., CEAT, 200-

I fell inlove with my fubu.Hindi naman hindi maiiwasan to di ba? Actually, I confessed to her already na Im falling for herto the point na sabay kami babyahe over the weekend and sometimes she let me stay sa kanila kahit nandoon ang ate niya. She really loves to be chased by me.I asked her again if she wants to stay like this, as fubu lang. She replied that she was happy with me like this. Sana lang daw walang magbago and everything. So there. I did my best to make her happy, to make her fall for me, too. Ayoko na kasi ng hanggang kama lang ang relationship namin. Gusto ko ako na hahawak sa kamay niya, susunduin siya, kasabay niya kumaen and other sweet things a boyfriend does to make his girl happy and feel loved.Now, December came and I thought of confessing again once more pero I was late. I was three months late! (TT^TT  I so happen to pass by her profile and saw a lot of pictures of her and her 3-month boyfriend. I was dumbfounded. Seriously.

I have something to say to all the sons out there. To all the boys, to all the men, to all of us. Its about women, and how they are not mere objects with curves that make us crazy. No, they are our wives, they are our daughters, our sisters, our grandmas, our aunts, our nieces and nephews. Well, not our nephews. They are our mothers. And you know somethin, folks?

I met my first love again for the first time after a decade in an event in UP.I have never really loved anyone aside from him, yes, for ten years. Back when we were  best of friends, weve known everything about each other, yet he never told me that I was his first love, too. We are both UP students.After the event, he walked me home.He confessed his feelings.This is the moment I have been waiting for for ten years, so I confessed my feelings too.Next day he kissed me.Then we had sex.........Eh tapos may girlfriend na pala si kuya. Pakyu tol! Hayup ka! Tacsiapo!!!!!-Mara, CDC, 09
I really dont miss Elbi. I am not planning on going back anytime soon. Back in college, I dont mingle a lot. Sure, I can be friendly, but I dont socialize probably because of different interests. I had friends but our closure after graduation wasnt good. They gave a lot of excuses whenever I arrange meetups with them. But when they decided to go to UP fair one time, they did not even invited me to join them. I had a fling before, but it also ended poorly (Ive moved on, fyi . I didnt join any org because I prefer doing activities alone (like, walking or biking around the campus, jogging at Pili Drive during nighttime or even late at night, visiting IRRI during my spare time . I really wasnt the loner student type, but even though Ive met different kinds of people during my stay, none of them established that special kind of connection to me.But now that I am already working,  Ive finally found the connection I was looking for that I didnt found before, and I thank my co-workers for that. Even though theyre from other (top  schools, theyve still cared for me and loved me for who I am.At one point I did care to the people around me, or at least to the people I was referring above -- my so-called friends and that guy -- but they have forsaken me. Maybe they never understood me or knew me.

I sometimes question myself why are we even living, if the end results will be the same, death. I know family and friends and all, and they do make me happy.    But at what cost? Im not suicidal at all, I just cant find a reason to keep living. I did not even want to come to UP, learning stuff do excite me but its more of a hobby than a need, as I dont have financial problems. Maybe what I lack was problems itself to keep the excitement of life, or I needed a vacation, or a lovelife. I dont know, I just came to the point Im happy but had enough. Wonder if thats called contentment.Go ahead lay all the criticisms on me. ahh syang buhay., madaming tao may problema taz ikaw...

I was the one who told you that you passed the UPCAT. I would remember that day when I called you up, and you wouldnt believe me. You thought I was joking. You were excited to go to elbi, I was ahead by one year, and you said that our highschool was not the same without me. We were good friends, and I was fine with that.Yet things changed when you said you loved me. I didnt want to ruin the friendship, but you never understood. You annoyed me with your persistent and insistent texts and FB messages of saying that you liked me, and wanted to become more than friends. I became distant, and we grew apart.I never gave you a chance; you were simply not my type. You said you understood. I seldom replied to your texts, and did not open the FB messages since the seen feature came about.Then one day, a text from your blocmate told me that you were gone. I checked the FB messages that I had never read, and it was there that you told me you were sick. Very sick.I never had the chance to tell you to get well soon, or be healthy, or to even visit you.I regret the times I have been insensitive, but theres nothing I can do about itI still see your face in my dreams. To be honest, I still wish I could talk to you. I miss you and your text messages. Rest well, you will be missed.-- Regretful, CAS, 20**-****
I wore my best girly dress just to standout somehow in our PI10 class. I am not really like the girly girls you see around the campus but just so you know, I did that for you. To much of my disappointment you were absent that day.I am out of my mind the whole one hour and twenty minutes, thinking what is wrong with myself. I am deeply in love to a person I dont even know. I dont know his name and I dont know how his voice sounds like, I just know that he completes my day everytime I see him. I always wanted to talk to you. But everytime I see you, you are either busy talking to someone or you are busy listening to music. You will just take off your earphones when the class is about to start - every single time. My heart is full of what-ifs. What if I talked to you that day?what if I gave you the chocolates i bought? What if, what if. What if?To TEF, you dont know how thankful I am that there something like this page/group. This is a very good venue for introverts like us to express ourselves.To kuya S.A, im not sure but i think 3R or 4R is his recit section. He always wear nice clothes. You can actually tell its him when you see him because of that.To my jose rizal, i really think this will be my last confession.

Im waiting for you. Id like to tell myself that youd be ready some time now. That we could hold hands like normal couples would. That wed be able to sit in the Fpark until sunset, without hiding, and judging stares. You told me that if I really loved you Id be willing to wait. I did. I am still waiting. I am willing to, even if it takes forever and a day. I long for that moment when we could finally be able to walk in the rain or stargaze in the park, just as we planned during that night when I stayed over your dorm. It was also the night you kissed me. It was our first. That kiss. Youre ready, I thought. I guess Ive never been wrong. I guess you still loved your family more. I mean, who doesnt? But please dont deny the fact that we had something. I needed assurance. I needed to know that somehow we counted. That it wasnt just a flash in the pan feeling or just a phase. God knows it wasnt. It was fucking magic. And now, it hurts.5 months.3 weeks.6 days.Wherever are you now, just know that I will be waiting.-TheManWhoCantBeMoved, CDC, 20**
In response to the one who posted about people who dress up too much in campus, you definitely have the right to be annoyed but I hope it wont get to a point where you offend the people you refer to. Anyway, in other schools, specifically those in Manila, what may seem too much for you may be normal for them, or maybe even under dressed. We should consider that students studying in UPLB are not all from UPLB, most  are from Manila. This is what is normal to them. Besides, what kind of image do you want to show visitors from outside when they see UPLB students wandering around the campus in  just slippers, a shirt, and shorts? Also, we should respect our professors. They take time to dress up, to be presentable as a professional while they teach students who do not even bother to dress properly. At least wear a decent pair of closed shoes, and maybe some pants. Save the slippers and shorts for your pambahay.I actually admire those who take time to wear a decent outfit, and even appreciate those who, for others, may seem to overdress. It is their way of presenting their selves, it is how they identify their selves. And at the same time it is not disrespectful to our UPLB faculty.Try checking admu or dlsu, and you wouldnt see a lecture hall full of people wearing slippers. It is very nice.- ab, CDC,2012

Ive been reading most TEF confessions; nakakaaliw, nakakabaliw   Some posts talagang makakarelate ka especially if tatak UPLB ka. There are some posts/comments about UPLB men- I agree they are different, iba kung magmahal. Met my first and greatest love at UPLB several decades ago (yes, mga oldies na po kami now . I was 17 and he was 21 (medyo kikay lola nyo . Di naman gwapo pero iba ang dating pag ngsasalita, maginoo pero medyo bastos. At dahil poor boy, sariling gawa ang greeting cards. In other words, knows how to make you feel like a lady. We were together for 1 1/2years pero hindi din naging kami. I pursued a medical career and he is into organic farming. But recently we reconnected thru fb. Tatak UP pa rin ang lolo nyo- ng MMS ng flowers kasi hindi daw nalalanta   Probably we still care for each other pero di na pwede.

But always remember, your main purpose is to study and only a few are chosen to be in UPLB. More power and goodluck sa studies, kids!
Ive read this post/confession here in TEF regarding to those students who arent happy on the course theyre taking and encouraging them to shift into another course.Well, somehow I can relate to that situation. I want to shift into another course and I have to do it  this coming school year in August. I am a freshman by the way.Its not that I dont want and not happy about the course I am taking right now, it is for some other reason why I wanted to shift.My problem is that I really dont know what course I would shift into. I have some in my mind but the problem is the grade requirements and evaluating my performance last sem and this sem, I think my grades can not meet the required grades of the courses I have in mind.And thats it. Anyone who can suggest courses, preferably science related ones, and the requirements needed? And what to do and how will I be able to shift into another course?It would be a great help to me if you have ideas concerning about this confession.Thanks. God Bless!Magshi-shift sa Di pa Alam na Kurso!,2013, CAS
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE - BRUNO MARSTheres this very cute girl na laging nagpapaganda ng araw ko. Una ko syang napansin sa may bulletin board sa PhySci bldg. Shes laughing by herself while reading things posted there. Tinititigan ko siya and luckily hindi niya ko napansin.Her smile - unfading. And her eyes - completely innocent.Looks like mahilig siyang magbasa ng posts sa bulletin board dahil dun ko siya madalas abutan. At tuwing nakikita ko siya, nahahawa ako sa mga ngiti niya. Hindi ko alam yung course niya at first pero nakita ko siya once na naka-ICS shirt and I felt very happy that time. I concluded na higher batch sya sakin since sure ako na hindi ko sya batchmate. But we are coursemates, so I was really very happy.Kaya lang, nawalan ako ng pag-asa. Nakita ko kasi siyang may ka-holding hands one time. Heres the catch kilala ko yung guy and I cant say moreWala akong laban.Despite everything, I still admire her. Her eyes that make the stars look like theyre not shining. Shes so beautiful and I want to tell her that everyday, unfortunately I cant.- admiral, CAS, 2011-*****

Kwentong sampaguita.Kasama ko roommates ko papuntang DL Umali, nanood kami ng talk ni Ben Cabrera. Tapos, pinanood din namin yung exhibit ng kanyang art works. Nagpictorial din kami sa pahigang puno sa tabi ng DL kasi ang ganda nung pagkaberde nung mga dahon noon. Tapos, naglakad kami palabas para kumain sa McDo sa Vega.Pula ang suot kong t-shirt. Nagdadaldalan kami ng roommates ko habang naglalakad. Bago kami tumawid dun sa may malapit sa ginagawang building ni Migs Zubiri, lo and behold! Dumaan si crush at ang iba pa nyang friends!Hindi naman kami magkakilala, pero madalas ko syang nakikita noon sa Annex 2 na padaan daan. Gwapo, mestiso, matangkad. Isa sya dun sa sikat na kambal ng CEAT.Anyway, nauna sila sa amin maglakad palabas din ng gate. At, kahit wala naman talagang ibig sabihin, kinikilig ako kasi nakapulang t-shirt din sya! Nung napadaan sila sa may UP Gate, may lumapit sa kanya na nagtitinda ng sampaguita. Bumili sya. Pero pagkatapos nun, iniwan lang nya sa isang tabi. At dahil sobrang kukulit ng roommates ko (buti na lang hindi naririnig ni crush nung inaasar nila ako sa kanya! , kinuha nila yung sampaguita at nilagay sa paper bag. At ibinigay sa akin nung makauwi na kami.Alam kong medyo biohazard na, pero nakita ko pa ulit yung paper bag nung naglinis ako ng kwarto.

LOVE LETTER TO NO ONENaniniwala ako at malakas pananalig ko na kapwa ko galing UPLB ang makakatuluyan ko. Bakit? Kasi iba ang mga tao dito. Magkaka-wavelength lahat at may pagka-weird. I like weird people because its something you cannot copy. Unique ang pagiging weird ng mga taga-UPLB. Kasi kahit na maraming katarantaduhan nang nagawa ang halos lahat ng kalalakihan dito, at least na-experience na nila at baka sakaling nakakuha na sila ng hinahanap nilang experiences mula dito at may kasama pang lesson to make them a man. (Id like to believe.  Dahil kapag pareho kayong taga-LB, maraming common grounds. Maraming pwedeng mapag-usapan at ma-reminisce na mga bagay-bagay. Dahil hindi ka nila itatratong damsel in distress kasi alam nilang strong tayong mga babaeng taga-LB at marami nang experience sa mga bagay-bagay.  Hindi nila tayo kayang i-opress. (Medyo feminist na view. HA HA At higit sa lahat, may certain appeal ang mga kalalakihan dito. Hindi man nabiyayaan ng gandang lalaki eh may ipambabato naman pagdating sa intellect and sense. Im not speaking for every one, opinyon lamang ito ng isang pangkaraniwang babae. Nakaalis na ko sa LB pero binabalik-balikan pa rin ito. Bukod sa pagbisita sa mga kakilala, iba pa rin yung nakakasalamuha ko ritong mga guys. They are easy to get along at iba ang flow of conversation with them. Siguro nga may friend/s akong lalaki na hinahanap ko talaga pag bumabalik ng LB. Siguro nga may wishful thinking din na baka sakaling may mabuong sparks. Pero sana talaga taga-LB ang susunod kong magiging boyfriend. Yung tipong kapag sabay na kami bumisita ng LB ay magtataka mga tao paano nabuo yung love story namin to think na hindi naman kami masyado nagkakasama nung college. Tipong magbibigay ng pag-asa yung love story namin sa mga namamag-asa pa na maisulat UPLB style din ang love story nila. Kaya ikaw na matagal ko nang hinihintay (3 years and counting , naway magkita na tayo at magkaroon ng lakas ng loob to take a risk na magpakilala sakin or vice versa, na mag-initiate na itext ako after ng ating meet-cute, na mag-aya na lumabas, at sana mag-blossom into something more. Promise di ka magiging under. Ipagluluto kita ng masasarap na food at pagaaralan ang recipe ng paborito mo. Mamahalin kita nang buo and unconditionally. Kaya magpakita ka na or magparamdam. Theres just something about men in UPLB. <3- Hopeful, CHE, 200* - *777*

Mahal na mahal ko siya. At naniniwala akong mahal na mahal niya rin naman ako.Minsan (na siguro nagiging madalas , nagkakaroon kami ng mga misunderstandings. Hindi naman ako tulad ng ibang gf na yung side lang nila yung titingnan nila at sila parati ang tama. Sa tingin ko nga, sa mga misunderstandings namin hinahanapan ko nalang ng mali yung sarili ko para magkaroon ako ng dahilan or kumbaga push sa sarili ko para ako ang lumapit at mag-approach then mag-apologize. Madalas hindi niya ata ramdam na syempre sana ma-feel ko namang naiisip niya rin yun.. na sana ginagawa niya rin. Hindi ko naman masabi sakanya dahil kilala ko siya at isa nanamang hindi pagkakaintindihan yun.May mga times na wini-wish kong may magkagusto sakin dito sa Elbi na you know.. yung tipikal na ligawan then mag-eend up sa mostly masayang relasyon. Ewan ko, parang gusto ko kasing maexperience naman yun.. Or siguro sobrang rare ng hinihiling ko, galing siguro sa kapapanood ko ng mga pelikula/teleserye atbp. Hahaha.Pero alam kong magwowork yung relasyon namin. Hindi kami attractive pareho kaya alam kong maliit ang chance na magka-third party.

Marami akong kilalang UPLB students na may potential na manalo sa I am Pogay ng Showtime. Mga gwapo, malakas ang appeal, matatalino, matangkad, at higit sa lahat gay or bisexual sila.

Kung sana bawat stalls ay may basurahan at bawat sulok ng FebFair grounds ay may basurahan na pinapalitan o nililinis every day edi sana, kahit papano, nabawasan yung basura.

Most girls in college, they are usually fascinated with a specific group of men. Because when youre involve in any one of them. It will make you known. But let me ruin this fascination of yours, ladies and beckies by confessing something.I will ruin your fascination of fraternity and Im thinking if I should namedrop which frat this is. Lets see.I may have consumed too much alcohol but I swear I remember. I was never the type to ask What happened last night? after a hangover.I was always invited by this group of men whenever they would hang out, usually in their rich brods place or anywhere they feel free to drink. I have a lot of friends in their group anyways so whenever they ask me out, Id say yes. And besides I was kinda liking someone here so yeah, grab it!I was drunk and sleepy I wanted  to sleep already. I told them that. Someone offered to walk me to the room so I could sleep. I felt the cushion on my face, it was so soft I fell asleep immediately. Just when I thought I was in deep slumber, I heard laughter. Laughter of a group of men, and I felt cold. I knew my clothes were too tight but I couldnt feel any of them. Just when I was about to open my eyes, someone forced me to open my mouth and inserted something in it. Yes, you were right, it was a penis of a man. I was forced to do a blowjob. I wanted to cry and shout but I couldnt. I wanted to run but someone was on  top of me. I was also penetrated. And after one man, another came and another and another. I wasnt sure if it was an organ or just a finger. I decided to just close my eyes, what would they do if they knew I was awake. I would say I enjoyed it a little.Well, it was I. But what if it was an innocent girl who knew nothing. As far as I know, they recorded it. Im not the kind of girl who would blame others for my mistake. I just want to say that, what if it was someone else. I can stand up for myslelf. But what if..Its true then kapag kumapit ka nga naman sa satanas sisikat ka(yo . Malalaos din kayo.....Xoxo- gossipgirl, CDC, 2009-*****
Mr. Dominic Lindog, BSCS Batch 2011, tall, dark, and handsome. 3I met you at Centtros arcade. Me and my Korean friends were goofing around with the Kinect machine. You were just standing there, arms crossed, silently watching, with a straight posture.Never did I know back then that you are quite the dancer. I was only able to see all that when it was my turn to dance alone and I had trouble with the interface of the game Just Dance 4. You stepped up and helped me. I was more than shocked when you started speaking in Korean. I was starting to like you.We exchanged names, and you even initiated a handshake, and that was the first time I held your hand. It was tight, soft, and larger than mine. I liked you even more for that.I asked you to dance with me. You instantly accepted the offer. I smiled at you, then you smiled at me too. After dancing, I introduced you to all of my friends. When they were about to leave, and I had this dilemma of choosing whether I would go with them, or will I ask you to stay with me for a while.It was really a good thing you offered to buy me ice cream from the stand near the escalator. It made me more confident of choosing the latter.And so they left. We found ourselves sitting by the nearby bench and exchanged interests and stories. But what got me excited the most is when you showed me a photo of you, Jessica and TaeYeon of Sonyeo Shidae, for I was a fan too!That day is the best day I had here in Los Ba�os, and I just want you to know that I am about to go back to Seoul. Thank you for everything! I wish we would see each other again in the future, maybe when you go to Seoul sometime? I would love to hear from you. ; -chingu, GS, 20**

I could not introduce myself to you. You seemed to be with a guy around that time and I didnt want to show any form of disrespect.We exchanged glances in that 30-40 minute timeframe. Those glances were short moments of bliss. I couldnt stop smiling.Im pretty sure you noticed all of my friends turning their heads just to have a look at you as well. Sorry about that. I was planning to buy you something from not-so-popular candy/snack bar inside that same building and leave a note to introduce myself but I hesitated. You were with someone else.

November 13, WednesdayAround 530 in the afternoonVega Centre Parking LotI was smoking in my usual spot when you and your girlfriends came to smoke as well. I was sitting on the leftmost part of the last column (the one near the back entrance of the building , facing the wall; you and your friends on the rightmost of the same column. I cannot actually see your face but I was attracted to you because of the way you speak and well, because you smoke. Theres this always weird force that evokes my interest towards smokers. Anyway, you were right there and I am just listening to every single word youre saying. I was hoping you would mention your course and batch while you were talking to your girlfriends, but to my dismay, you didnt. I noticed your friends were already packing their things; I was wishing youre going to stay for another cigarette or two, AND YOU DID! The moment your friends left I leaned on the column so that I could get a clear view of your face and you, you faced the wall across you. I was in heaven. You have glasses which I hope are prescriptions and not those hipster specs that people think look cool. You were wearing a white raglan shirt with gray sleeves. You have really long and dirt nails but I didnt mind. You are an angel. I was meaning to talk to you, but I didnt know what to say. Im really shy and I dont want you to think Im a creeper.You started to move suggesting youre about to leave. I started to panic. I dont know if Ill start to talk to you or I dont know, poke you maybe? But that would be weird so I just froze from where I am seated and you left. A few steps away from the spot you smoked and you looked back. You checked if you left anything. You did left something... or someone. You left me. It was just a missed connection. If you think youre this guy who smoked today, Wednesday, 13th of November, at around 530pm, I will be waiting for you on the same day, same time, and same spot next week... and the following weeks until I get the courage to ask for your name. And maybe your contact number. Or I dont know, maybe until I convinced you to go out with me, I guess. Dont let this be a missed connection for the two of us. Ill be waiting.   -Boy, Im A Shy Boy, CHE, BSHE, 20**

One Silangan Place. Second Semester 2012-2013Madalas akong tumatambay sa dorm ng kaibigan ko sa OneSi. Apat sila sa isang room, at lahat sila ay mga kaibigan ko rin. Kaya feel na feel ko lagi tumambay doon.Isang araw gabi na yun, mga 10 PM. Hinihintay ko ang sundo ko. Uwian kasi ako at may pinanuod akong play eh. Dalawa lang kami sa dorm. Nagf-facebook ako, yung kasama ko, nanunuod ng anime. Naka-earphones siya at alam kong full volume siya kasi medyo rinig ko. Okay naman ang lahat, tahimik ang paligid. Hanggang sa humangin ng malamig, nakakapanindig balahibo. Nagtaka ako, kasi sarado yung pinto. Pati bintana nila. So, kebs. Hinayaan ko nalang. Tapos, mas naging weird kasi parang may kumakatok sa pinto nila. Tinignan ko yung friend ko, parang hindi niya naririnig. So ako nalang yung lumapit sa pinto at binuksan ko ito.Pagkabukas ko, parang may hangin na bumangga sakin. Kasabay nito may boses na parang bumulong sakin ng words na hindi ko maintindihan. Sobrang natakot ako, kaya bumalik ako sa tabi ng friend ko. Nagtataka siya, bakit daw ako nakatayo lang sa pinto.Hanggang ngayon, hindi ko parin alam kung ano ibig sabihin noon.~ScaredFriend, CAS,2012

Para sa kaibigan ko dating nagtanong dati kung bakit naniniwala na ako ke God, ito yung sagot ko, sana mabasa mo  Kagaya mo may pagkaskeptic din akong tao dati. Galing ako sa isang science high kaya exposed ako sa mga theories and concept na pilit quenequestion. Haha ..Hinahanapan ng mga kasagutan ang mga bagay- bagay. Then upon my realizations I came to realize many things;1. Our sun - diba sabi sa science, sun is powered by H and He (kung ndi ako ngakkamali , lets say our sun exists  for 10 000years, then narealized ko, ndi ba nauubos ung mga elements na nagfufuel dun?. Bakit existing para rin ung sun up to now. Thereﾒre must be SOMEONE who is powerful enough that sustains the sun.2. Big bang theory ﾖ Sabi nung mga scientists there is a big explosion that happened for the creation of the universe. Then the question is who put that massive particle that caused explosion? [If that really happened.]3. Yung planet nten, have you been amazed how this planet works. Yung perfect location ng earth along its orbit.. Scientist believed that little adjust lng sa position ng earth masusunog tau or magyeyelo kc sobrang ideal nung current position nia. Ang tanong ko dati, cnu ung nglagay nung earth sa perfect position to support life? 4.Processes - like the water cycle sobrang amazing kaya nung process nila and I can say na ndi un product ng explosion. Ung pagkakaiba ﾖiba ng faces naten individually to our voices sobrang nakakaamazed kc wala taung katulad..There is SOMEONE that is so intelligent that created and designed these things. Andami pa friend tingin-tingin ka lang sa paligid mo, mas maging curios ka lang..kung paano yun nagwowork and you will see .Siguro ndi mag-aagree yung iba sa mga sinabi ko, but many of these are just products of my observations.

Payong (2010 Classmate ko si CEAT guy sa chem at math subjects ko noong semester na yun. Matalino siya kasi consistent topnotcher siya sa mga exams namin. Siya pa nga unang nagapproach sakin noong isang math lecture namin kasi nabobore na siya. Naging friends naman kami kasi mabait siya. After ng isang chem exam namin (night exam , ang lakas ng ulan. Pagkalabas ko ng exam room, nakita ko siya. Lalapitan ko sana kaya lang pumunta siya doon sa isang wing. So paalis na ako, binuksan ko ung payong ko at naglakad na ko nang biglang may taong sumilong sa payong ko. si CEAT guy! sabi niya pasabay raw (sa campus ung dorm niya . Habang naglalakad kami, medyo nadulas ako. After that sabi niya siya na raw hahawak ng payong. Ihahatid ko sana siya, kaya lang kailangan ko na talagang umuwi. Pagkarating namin kay Mariang Banga, sabi niya okay na siya so nagpasalamat at tumakbo na siya. Nawala tuloy ung lungkot ko dahil sa exam.  Natapos ang sem na un at nakauno siya sa math at bumagsak naman ako. Nagkita ulit kami sa pila sa cashier noong registration for second sem. Even though nahihiya ako aminin, sinabi ko sa kanya na bumagsak ako. After a few minutes, binigyan niya ako ng papel. Gawa raw kami ng paper box. Natawa ako pero ginawa ko pa rin.    After that, matagal ko rin siyang di nakita. Minsan ko lang siyang makasalubong. The next time na nakita ko siya, may dala siyang shoulder bag. Shoulder bag ng katabi niyang girl. Nalungkot din ako noon after a few weeks, pero natanggap ko na rin. CEAT guy, kung mabasa mo ito. Thank you. Thank you for being my inspiration for a certain time.

Post-break up tendencies can lead to something. We agreed to go out drinking to down our problems and have a good time by smoking and drinking. There we were, drinking some poorly-prepared mixed drink while smoking the whole pack our other friend bought. We were talking a lot but we had to go to the bathroom a lot because what we were drinking has quite a punch on our bladders. We took turns, first me and our friend, then you and me.I cant help it I guess, I was carefree. So I told you that I had a crush on you way back when we started going to the same lab section. But you told me that you like, even until then.We went back to our table then let our friend go do her thing while we talk and flirt. Eventually we all decided to go back to the apartment and sleep. But we both knew somethings up. When our friend turned in, we went out to smoke and talk.As our talk progresses, our hands went to places all over each others bodies. Yours found my boobs and I found your bulge. We kiss, we fondle, we play tongue wrestling until we eventually unzipped each other but two guys passed by. We hurriedly fixed ourselves but we both know it was not over.Laughing, we went inside, shushed each other for fear we might wake up our friend then went to the bathroom.I unzipped your jeans and you pulled my shorts down and I held you in my hands. You pushed me to the wall, face-front and took me fast. You took me hard and fast and I was muffling my moans. You made me face you to the side and you kissed me, all the while releasing my boobs from their prison. It was a quickie, we might get caught. So we finished each other off fast. We got out and laid down beside our friend.It was just in time because one of her housemates needed to use the bathroom. We giggled then fell asleep after a few moments. We should do it again sometime. I remember it, I told you I wasnt that drunk.- lian, CAS, 20**-**5**
Prologue2/3/2014 915PMHello Sarah here. I have given the second clue to the lucky ones. They didnt know what was in store for them.But you can be a part of it too.I have succesfully partnered with the Elbi Files and I know one of their admins. So it is guaranteed safe.But is it really safe? Is it really calming to know that there are entities around us waiting to be discovered. The game has just started and I am aware of the hype that this game brings.But amidst the crowds of people excited for the one treasure that I was looking for, there is this malefic horror that seeped through my veins. I was cursed by this treasure once, but its owner has said to me these words.Sarah, thou regain your soul. Activate the orb of conjugation in the valley of silicon.I was gained the apocryphal power of knowledge so I decoded her words in a matter of minutes. I interpreted it as.In order to get the treasure, you must find companions in the online world.Now that you know one of my reasons. Please help me regain what I have lost. Here is my next clue.I cannot lead you to the place itself. If I do, Mother Balingkinitang Agila will hear me and send me to trial with the Kusangihimans of Makiling. There they will sentence me to hermitage in the mountains.Help me fight the curse of the foul witch of Makiling and regain the treasure that will free us all.Clue 2 lt8beFBnkamar@o12- Sarah, CAS, 2010-*****

REGRETSIm not a virgin anymore. Out of lust and love (or I just thought so , I and my ex-boyfriend did it several times. Because our relationship wasnt that steady back then, we chose to compensate the fights by making love. Isnt that stupid? Im in deep regret now for being a foolish victim of lust!I had already gone to a priest for a confession, hoping that I would be forgiven by the Almighty from the wrong thing Id done. And yet I myself cannot forgive myself for doing such thing. Yes, for me it is a sin. For not seeing sex as a sacred gift from the Lord.

SMP?Oo, Samahan ng Masasaya ang Pasko, yan na sana ako....Ngunit eto 3 days nalang bago magpasko naging Samahan ng Masasakit ang Pasko....Biruin mo ba naman, from being hated by her for almost a sem, nagustuhan nya ako at minahal ngunit eto nga, ayaw daw nya na maging ex ko, kaya friends nalang daw kami. Pwede namang maging kami hanggang sa huli diba? Gagawin ko naman lahat para sa kanya, alam naman nya na kaya ko yung gawin kasi sobrang hirap ng pinagdaanan ko sa panliligaw ko sa kanya, alam nya yun kaasi sobrang pinahirapan nya ako. Kilalang kilala naman niya ako dahil buong buhay ko nakwento ko sa kanya, kahit yung mga ex ko kilala nya, alam nya rin yung mga ginawa namin(wag masyadong green-minded people . Sobrang open ako sa kanya, alam nya kung anong habits ko, alam nya mga paborito ko, kahit nga iniisip ko alam nya agad sa isang tingin palang sakin. Parang siya na yung kalahati ko eh    haaaaay.....Mahal na mahal ko sya, gagawin ko lahat para lang maging masaya sya.

Sobrang close namin ng boyfriend ko. At lahat sinasabi ko sa kanya. Ganon din siya sa akin. One time, nag open up ako sa kanya, na I think I have lesbian tendencies. Sinabi ko sa kanya na may mga crush akong girls at minsan pinapaspantasyahan ko sila. Knowing him, pagtatawanan niya lang lahat ng sinabi ko, and he did.

Submitting a confession here was never an option for me, but then Ive got nothing to lose anyway so here goes (never good at explaining things btw .Dear Best Elise PH,Im not as good as you are in writing poems so let me just regularly state what I have to say.You know how close weve been for the past few years, and last year may have been our closest. You were right. We used to laugh at the stupidest things, cuddled each other and shared great memories together. But one day it came to me, What am I to you?. Everything was vague so I said to myself, Hey, we should stop this nonsense.. There. Big mistake. Ive been waiting for you to trash talk me in the face but like always you wont talk to me unless I talk to you first. I miss you day and night, I just didnt want to admit it to myself. Ive always wanted to tell you how I feel but I was afraid of rejection. Forever afraid. Flings or whatever, Its always been you. But I guess youre gone now.Good luck with everything.

Im really sorry I couldnt muster up the courage to ask you.I know you dont like me saying this, but Im just not the type of guy girls usually like.I hang out at galleries, I like tea, I dont play sports, Im skinny [love]... etc.be that as it may, call me a hipster, like you always do,but let me say this, Ive wouldve never enjoyed life if I hadnt met you.so, thank you... thank you talaga. seeing that this may be your last year in college,I hope you live a good life out there, you deserve it.as for me, I still have a few semesters to take.felines [with laser beam eyes], fly, fly... fly.- viriliter ad sidera, CAS, 2009-*****

The Cotton Snow(Not a very structured poem, but please pardon me (I dedicate this to all those... well, you know who you are As another bright Sunday morning comes by,from the increasingly warm pre-summer skyThe ever-exhausted graduating student asks,Will I be joining the march after March?Looking at the time that seemed so fast,and all the seemingly infinite taskFuck that Study hard, party harder,why the hell didnt I do this earlier?Despite those nights that he did not sleep,Hes done only 40% of his manuscript,Also, his powerpoint presentation is a big of a mess,He said to himself Goodluck na lang sa thesis defense.Then he starts imagining the face of his adviser,As well as the disappointed faces of his mother and father,No! He said to himself, I have to do this!I will not surrender to this stupid thesis!And there he pushed through this seemingly endless battle,Against the mind-numbing flood of this very complex matter;Which is a mixture of numbers, graphs, and statistical analyses,Even though most of it, to him, makes little sense.And now, two years after this unforgettable experience,he always recall what he learned from those days,that every graduating student is destined to know,What it feels like during the season of the Cotton Snow.- FrustratedPoet,2006, BS CHEM, CAS

The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face - Celine Dion.The first time ever I saw your face, I thought the sun rose in your eyes...Matagal na akong AWOL pero pagala-gala pa rin ako sa campus...Isang beses nang mapadaan ako sa Vega, may nakasalubong akong cute na kuya, halatang freshie (2007 noon . Oo sobrang cute nya! Gusto ko sanang magtapang-tapangan para kilalanin siya pero di ko nagawa dahil dali-dali siyang pumasok sa elevator. Susundan ko sana kaso fourth floor ang tungo. At dahil Thursday noon at past 6pm, mukhang papunta si kuyang cute sa Victory service. Siyempre dahil di naman ako taga-Victory (Katoliko ako  di ko hinabol si Kuyang cute. Ops! Alam ko na!

Pero di talaga mabura fez ni kuyang cute sa utak ko eh.Labo lang, after four years tsaka ko lang nalaman name at course ni kuyang cute.

The University of the Philippines is the epitome of Filipino culture. The fact that there exists a diverse region representation strengthened this idea. If the university claims honor and excellence, then, by all means why cant it design and enforce efficient procedures for every transaction in the university? We provide academic programs that trade with different process optimization techniques. We have institutes that are considered center for excellence in their fields. And yet I see endless lines and steps for just transaction simple transaction. Are we missing something? Or the University administration is baffled in an epoch that is no longer known to humankind?( Photo taken from a Facebook post.  Scholar,2011, BSCS, CAS

This happened some time ago, but I remember everything like it was yesterday.Since were my boyfriend studies in a different university back home, the best we can do to satisfy that certain need is through a video chat, Skype. That time, wala ang roommates ko sa dorm so I decided its the perfect time to do that business. I put on the sexiest bra I have and went online. We were really into it, him on the phone and in the video window. I removed my bra and my shorts. I was left with his shirt that he lent me before and my panties. When he asked for more, I slowly pulled my shirt up, up, up while the same thing is happening to his junk. When I finally removed my shirt, exposing my greatest asset, BOOM, pasok si roommate. I played it cool by slowly putting my shirt back on as if I was trying to dress up.Of course we were both disappointed, and just chatted until the wee hours in the morning. He called me by 6am telling me that I should get up because I have to go out and meet his cousin. I took a shower, and went out of my dorm.But by the gate, instead of his cousin, it was him. He took me out for breakfast then I went to my class for a few hours while he toured the campus with my cousin. When I was done with my last class for the day, I told him we could go hiking since it was in my bucket list to go hiking with him. It was nice hike to Flat Rocks and after some time, we remembered we had some unfinished business. With the water outlining us making certain parts hard, we decided to continue it there more times than I remember until we decided it was time to leave.We were so happy I thought people can see right through our smiles but we couldnt care less. Hey, we got some on a random school day. Thats something for an LDR right? By the time he got home, I was waiting online. Only that time, I locked the door.-ccup, CAS, 20**-*****
This is not actually a confession, but I just wanna confirm a rumour I heard. Is it true that the UPLB has already confirmed the shift of the school year to August, and that the students have a four month summer break this year?Desperate,2013, CHE
This may not be the kind of confession that you would spend your time reading. This is not my real college though.I used to tell almost everything about me to my friends back in elementary and high school, hoping that they would accept me for who i really am. Too bad even some friends cant be trusted, they called me liar, and even insulted me indirectly.I am no longer the type of person who can speak freely of my own personal life. I do have friends, but none of them knows what had I truly been through.We are poor and I am solely dependent on the benefits that I acquire from the STFAP. Most people think that I am happy and outgoing, that I have a family who supports me all the way with regards to financial matters, and that I am strong enough to face all the obstacles in life. But that is not my case. I need to work as a student assistant just to pay for my daily food expenditures, I need to properly allocate my stipend for academic expenses and dormitory fee payments, and I need to study far from my family missing all our times together just to give them a good life. I envy those who were raised in a wealthy family and i hate those who dont value money. Yes, they can spend as much as they want without knowing how hard it is to save and earn.Three years have passed and I am now on the verge of reaching the end of my struggles. I may be tough but not strong enough to be left alone. I may not be an achiever but God knows Iﾒm doing all I can. I may not be the friend that youﾒre all ever wanted but this is me, and I will forever be grateful for you guys accepting me despite all my secrets. One day, I promise, Iﾒll tell you everything about me when I have the courage to do so.    Secrets, CDC,2010

I have been asking myself lately of how you manage to do that... and for the first time in my life, Id rather answer a long difficult math exam than answering that question. I didnt want to scare you or make things complicated. Camille, if youre reading this, Im sorry I cant let you know who I am.

To FormerFaculty, 2001-*****, CAS Dear Sir/Maam First of all, i respect what you have written regarding facebook and personal space, etc.. What you have enumerated may be actual observations on your part, however it pains me to even believe that this is the rule more than the exception (then again, you did say pansin ko lang . Maybe the simplest way to answer your concern is to admit that social media has been effective in what it does best eliminate any notion of privacy. And maybe those who are guilty of your enumerations deserve some level of indignation due to their improper (for lack of a better term  use of fb (or maybe even twitter, tumblr, etc . But to defend my colleagues, i guess (and as several comments have probably pointed out already  we are entitled to a life outside the teaching profession. And maybe the situations you have pointed out are exceptions, rather than the rule. Our personal relationships are our business; does it really affect our ability to deliver the required material if explicit pictures are out? If it does then we have a problem. But as we here have proven, it doesnt. Maybe it affects how the students now perceive our delivery. That is now their decision to work with. (Un? fortunately, this is UP, where the concepts of freedom of expression and academic freedom are interpreted practically up to delusional extents. That differentiates us from other universities with stricter rules. While we are at it, you also mentioned the distinction between teacher and student. I know, this might not be a fair comparison, but there are more students who blur this distinction you speak of, rather than the other way around. You have to admit that the students greatly outnumber the number of faculty here in UPLB, and much like how youve accused several (again, i insist on exceptions  of misbehaving in facebook, perhaps you might think of the reactions we would get if we posted something like done preparing a quiz tomorrow, cant wait!. Finally, its just facebook. Its a miasma of information where you choose what to believe; students who would construct their professors images solely based on what they see on a computer screen probably dont deserve to be taught by said professors. You did mention that we ask our students to be excellent, were being fair enough. We do our best not to judge students by what we hear from them or what they show in their profiles; we determine their capability and character in the classroom. Then again, maybe a shout-out would do the same thing. With all due respect, from faculty member to faculty member. CurrentFaculty,2004, CEAT

To the man who made me realized that falling in love is a wonderful thing,You are amazing and I love everything about you - Your mustache and short beard; the way you deform your mouth (making your upper gums visible  upon hearing a corny joke from me; your face (with your mouth slightly open  and the sounds you make when you are fast asleep; your silence when you are deep in thoughts; your obvious discomfort whenever youre undeniably jealous; the way you bargain whenever youre running out of funds; your mannerism of folding your neck several times as an indication of stress; and the curving of your eyes everytime you smile when we were together. I wonder if everybody close to you ever noticed all that. Everything about you seemed to interest me.I miss tapping your hand whenever you unconsciously start scratching your skin (you were always like that when youre pressured to answer an urgent question ; your piggyback rides; your company whenever I have to come home late at night; the way you hide yourself somewhere outside my dormitory to surprise me with food; and your naughty little tricks when trying to bully me (such as throwing my slippers on the grass when Im sitting with my feet above the ground .Thank you for eating my badly-cooked pancakes (Though, I already tried my best to impress you ; for letting me sleep on your arm while you were doing our programming project (and sorry because I blocked the keyboard making you use the on-screen one ; for laughing at my cries and carrying me on your back after tying the laces of my rubber shoes tightly together; for treating me as if I am some kind of a princess; and for making me feel like a girl by giving me gifts a woman receives. I even jumped several times inside my room upon receiving a white rose from you (that was my first time ; for letting me step on your feet while we were dancing; for hugging me when I am stressed; for letting me hold your hand whenever I am afraid, and for all other happy memories I could reminisce in times such as this.Its just hard to believe you are now so cold to me.-Priebusrand, CAS,2011

Tyrone Carodan,The very first moment I encountered you, my romantic world started to bloom. I never knew how it felt to be in love until I met you. I tried, really tried to describe how happy I was to meet you, but words failed me. I must admit that you got me hooked up on you right away, really. Youre nice and very approachable. I found you very different. Youre tall, good-looking, smart, very witty and never quits. That was Sept. 27, 2011.I dont know exactly if you still remember that day. But for me who really adores you, I would never forget it. We started out making our stories, imposing a good and a long one. I tried out in Mens Volleyball Team to get with you most of the time. Sadly after a short time, I stopped trying out and filed my paper to shift in Diliman. Years have passed and that long, I dont see you anymore. I left the place and moved here where I am now. That is something, Id wish, I didnt do. It saddens me whenever I remember those good times weve been in a short chapter of our story. We smiled, ran, walked, talked, and laughed and played together. Happily, youre now part of the Varsity Team. We started out texting again recently. And I hope, this time, well rebuild our abandoned stories. You missed me, you said. I missed you too. I want to hug you tightly, if its fine with you. I like you, I really do. I know, youll never like me back. And, I understand. Dont worry. I dont even want you to fall in love with me because you deserve someone better, someone who is good-looking, someone who is smarter than me or arguably, better than me. Above all, I just want you to know that youre my first love. No matter what it takes, no matter how far I am with you, you will take a special part in my heart. And that will last till forever to infinity and beyond.Masaya na ako na masaya ka na kahit hindi ako ang dahilan ng kasiyahan mo na yun. -FirstLove, CAS,2011, BS Math
UPCAT 13-14Umaga ng December 23. Right after i woke up, agad kong chineck ang facebook ko. I found out na lumabas na ang results ng UPCAT. Dali-dali akong bumangon at binuksan ang computer  kahit na pinagalitan ako ng aking ina na kasalukuyang gumagamit ng washing machine ( mamahal daw bayarin sa kuryente kapag pinagsabay e I immediately log in at dumiretso sa results page. *scroll* *scroll* click *scroll* Nasan yung apelyido ko? Ayun. Bagsak ako. Dahan dahan ay nangilid ang luha ko. Ang daming pumasok sa utak ko.Member na ko sa overheard. Na-like ko na lahat ng UP files. Shet.I failed. Dream school ko ang UP. I want to be an isko. Nakakaasar nga lang di pinatapos ang simbang gabi, pinapanata ko na e. Nilabas agad yung result xD. Dreams are dreams. I heard may reconsideration naman daw. I just hope atleast 2.8 UPG ko. Maiging isko rin ako. Tiwala lang. Pa-tip na rin po kung paano magpa-recon. ; - IskoWannaBe, Outside ElBi, CAS, 20**-*****

Were like A, were not meant to BDear SIR Wielson Factoleirin,I like the way your eyes lit when you smileI like the way your hands shake when you panicI like the way your lips look when you poutI like the way you put your hands on your pockets occasionallyI like the way you make little jumps when you ranI like the way your hair stays whatever it is you doI like you.I like everything about you, except for the fact that youﾒre not mine.Since kailangan ng Background Story, Not once did I look at you as crush-material until that mistake on my part. I started noticing everything about you. I know its hopeless.Kung gaano ako ka-hopeless sa Math ganun din to ka-hopeless. Pero naniniwala pa rin ako na baka isang araw..BAKA lang naman, mapansin mo naman ako, yung isang taong ikaw lang ang napapansin.P.S. Bakla po ba kayo? Nevermind. I dont care, Ill make you a manCircleAroundTheTriangle, CAS,2013
When I first saw you in our Math 17 class, I was easily attracted to your physical features. Your face that lit my dim path. Your height which think is compatible with mine. Your physique that I really like, for the reason that youﾒre not the thin one and not also the bulky one but the right one. And the one that really caught my eyes is your hair, especially your ﾓpatilyaﾔ that makes you really attractive for me. It also makes you look like a bad boy which Iﾒm looking for in a man.        After our first class, I immediately went home to look for you and add you in Facebook. I felt sad because I donﾒt know your name. But that didnﾒt stop me to look for your facebook account. I searched the facebook group of our section, opened every account to look if the account Iﾒm looking for is yours. It took me several hours before I found your account, I was so happy because I found your profile. I immediately hit the ﾓadd friendﾔ button and waited patiently for hours. I saw the notification that you accepted my request. Let the stalking begin.        Every day, I visit your profile at least once. I looked at your picture, browsed your timeline and gather all your information. By doing that it makes my day complete. I also get excited attending our class because thatﾒs the time that I will see you and when I see you I feel that I will faint. When I go near to you, it feels like Im only inches away from you, even if we are meters apart. As the days pass, I learned your true identity, your true self, and it made me even fall harder to you.        So the little things you did, like having eye contact to me, means a lot to me. But when the semester ended, my heart sank because there is a high chance that I wonﾒt see you as much as I wanted. But that is life, not all the things you want will come into your hands. This one-sided love story that started and ended with just me knowing you and you not knowing me, made my first semester happy and joyful. I wish you all the best and I wish I can see you often and if you like I want to be your friend Ugen.~Isko101, CAS,2013
Whenever youre around, I feel like a high school kid. Gone is the suave, mature, college man; here is left a blabbering, giddy little boy. When I hear you laugh. When all that stands between us is a few millimeters of empty space, and its all I can do not to touch you.I get that warm, fuzzy feeling in my stomach. I feel my hands get sweaty and my knees start to shake. My breath gets caught in my throat. I forget how to swallow, and I dont know what to say. My mind is a blank, but its racing in a million directions. But all directions lead to the same endYOU.My brain and my heart is a huge, jumbled, higgledy-piggledy mess.And to think, its been like this for such a long time now, I cant even remember when or how it started. Lets not put a name to what Im feeling. I just want you to know that its here.So, thanks The Elbi Files, youve given me a chance to say here what I could never say in person. And in all this commotion, I almost forgot to say who this entry is forThis is for you, Dione Maghirang. P.S. Yeah, lets go ahead and pretend that I dont know that you read The Elbi Files.   -OneLastShot, CA, 20**-*****
Wow, nagbago na pala ang link ng TEF for submissions. meron nang 3 categories kaya medyo nalito ako kung saan ako magcclick.Anyway, this is a secret I have yet to tell people who will actually listen.Kaninang hapon lang tumawag si Mama, kung anu-anong chenes na naman ang pinagsasasabi. Tapos bigla nyang sinabi, oh [insert my nickname @ home here], mag-aral ka ng mabuti ha? nag-iipon ako ngayon para sa gift ko sa yo pag-graduate mo! Yung iPhone na irrelease sa year na yun yung ibibigay ko sa yo!medyo natawa ako at naiiyak at the same time nun, ang lumabas lang sa bibig ko ay mm-hmm or parang ganun.tapos napunta na ulit sa ibang topic ang usapan namin ni Mama.tapos kani-kanina lang, pag-uwi ni Mama, nag-usap na naman kami. Tungkol ulit dun sa grad gift nya. Sabi pa nya, Dapat mag-aral kang mabuti! Dapat at least cum laude ka pag-graduate mo!Ganun ulit yung response ko sa kanya, yung mm-hmm... kasi may naalala ako.May grade ako na 5.0, 4.0 at INC. not to mention may mga 3.0 pa. parang iisa lang ang grade ko na nasa 1.0-1.75 range.ang dilemma ko ngayon ay posible pa kayang maging cum laude ako? could someone answer me please?

[Admin_Post]Dear Making Girls Wet,Dont you find it as a compliment when girls tell you sayang ka? Youre probably that handsome. Or that nice to them.But yea, its just a matter of perspective. You might be annoyed and irritated whenever you hear people saying sayang ka. But I hope youll just see the good in it.syet, ganun ako kapogi para manghinayang sila.Im just bothered with your last line.And to quote, Siguro nga kaya dumarami ang mga bading dahil bumababa na rin ang quality ng mga kababaihan.Dont you dare associate the increasing number of homosexuals to the quality of women. Believe me, theres not a correlation between the two.I do believe that homosexulity is a choice. Though there are studies claiming that homosexuals are already homosexuals at birth. And can you please tell me how did you say that bumababa ang quality ng mga kababaihan? I need reasons. I need basis. I need facts.I am bisexual, but I have never reasoned out the quality of men and women for me to become a lesbo.Its a choice my dear, its a choice. And its a feeling, yup. You just feel it. I admire and respect you for coming out of the closet but I just want to straighten out your maling pananaw. I advice you to take up Social Science 3 - Exploring Gender and Sexuality and Sociology 107 - Gender Relations. Try your best to take them under Miss Lea Marasigan, if ever shes still in the university. #ChickBoy

may gf ako ngayon, i love her.problem is attracted din ako kay dylan, di totoong pangalan.sexy si gf, mabait, sweet at magaling sa kama.dylan is also sweet, mabait, medyo kupal at magaling din sa kama.yes ilang beses na kaming nagsex ni dylan at lalo naman ang gf ko.everytime na magssex kami ni gf, si dylan ang nasa isip ko. na sana siya ang gumagawa ng role ni gf. na sana siya ang katabi kong walang suot. na sana katawan niya ang aking hinihimas himas. namimiss ko na kasi ang mga nakaraan namin ni dylan, although di naging kame. namimiss ko yung mga halik nya, yung mainit nyang katawan, at yung pagaalaga niya sa akin.si dylan ang kahinaan ko. ginawa ko to, umaasang mabasa ni dylan.dylan i miss you. dalaw ka naman sa apartment minsan. namiss ko na ang ating mainit na halikan.namiss ko na lahat sayo.puntahan mo naman ako pag wala si gf.

sir JACH is so hot.I never had the wonderful chance of becoming his student, but I came close. My course used to be comsci before reality ran me over and made it clear that coding is not for me. When I was still a cmsci freshie, I used to see him a lot around the PC labs. I didnt notice him at first. I had a friend who was his advisee. I tagged along with this friend all the time and that is how I kinda knew him. He may not know my name or remember my face but he is still the hottest person on this freaking planet. Favorite parts of the day was when I see him around PhySci and whenever I see him sweaty because he is so much hotter when he is sweaty. Is that weird?~pseudonym, CAS, 201*-*****, Socio
this happened years ago, when i was still in elbi.  isa sa favorite parking spots namin ni ex was in CEM.  one time, i dont know, sobrang high lang siguro, we skipped all of our classes and stayed in his apartment instead making love all day.  we practiced safe sex by the way, so may condoms.  nung maghahapon na, nagdecide naman kami tumambay sa aming favorite parking spot, and to my surprise, he brought with him the last condom he used, and well disposed it right on the parking lot. (reminded me of my freshie days, jogging on freedom park and near the fertility tree where may mga used condoms din akong nakitang nakakalat ang lakas lang mag trip.-foreshadow, CAS, 2---
this is post is not meant to offend anybody especially Maam Afuang ...To Ms. Afuang.Maam we all know how you are a great wildlife biologist, how you passed all your exams when in college and faced you terror teachers,that youve graduated in Diliman, that youve met a lot of famous people, that yoube been teaching for how many years. We (your students  all salute you for that. Theres nothing wrong in sharing these experiences, in fact we had fun hearing it in your class but sometimes dont you think its a little too much. Yes, your stories are great but sometimes we just want the lesson itself. The thing is the more you tell stories, the more you lose the thread of the lesson and then when its time to go back to the lesson theres so little time for discussion. You tend to quicken the phase of the lesson going slide after slide without really telling us anything. You expect us to get high scores in your exams when we cannot even comprehend what you are saying in front. You expect us to know what you are saying by just looking at your many so many handouts? We dont even know which of those are included! Do you think that we would be able to memorize all that? Just like in your second exam, (I failed  only two from a certain lab section passed. Out of how many? 15? You made an exam about Geologic time scale. that would have been all right if you told us which of the three GTS tables would be included. Then the enumeration part?! What the heck? We certainly did not expect that one but do you expect us to really memorize every single detail in your handouts? The funny thing is the things we have really studied did not really appear on the exam. On your third exam, the labeling?? That would have been alright if the pictures were clear enough. I heard one student says Tayo na friend, talon na sa Carillon, and Grabe exam ni Maam laslas pulso talon sa Carillon. Maam imagine how hard your exam must be for us o think of those things.Maam, I know all this because I am a student of yours and i really try my best to listen to you lectures, I promise but it really is getting on my nerves (and of my classmates  how you keep on ranting about things that are not really included on our lesson. Havent you noticed that never in one lecture did you not mention any thing about diliman or how you met people or any of your achievements? You are always telling us that we should be humble because we are the ISKOLAR NG BAYAN but how about you?And another thing is that we are also normal college students, our time is different from yours so please do not expect us to be quiet all the time. We would be quiet if we are really interested in what you are saying. There are so many times that me and my classmates are tempted to ditch your class its that I dont dare to because that means disrespecting you.Once you said that, Kayo tuwang tuwa kayo pag absent yung teacher tapos sa evaluation ibabagsak niyo you have a point maam but that is not true for all teachers. there are teachers that makes you sad because they are absent or that the sem is ending but sadly, I cannot count you as one of those teachers. Disclaimer This may not be true for all of your students. Its just how majority of the people I know feels.I must admit that Im too much of a coward to say this in your face but I meant this as a constructive criticism. I do not meant to offend you, I think that you are great at what you do and that you are a very kind teacher and I do respect you. I will still try my best to attend and listen to your lectures.-Popcorn 2013 CAS

#Philippines The head of a Canadian retiree is found seven months after his capture by Abu Sayyaf.  
And kudos to @BobRae48 for fighting the good fight behind the scenes, trying to secure Ridsdels release from Abu Sayyaf.
At least 13 Abu Sayyaf members have been killed since Sunday. Good luck to all the troops pursuing all these...  
My deepest condolences to the family of John Ridsdel. Abu Sayyaf is a minority group and do not represent the Phils.

Wag iasa ang pagbabago sa ibang tao o sa gobyerno lang. Kung gusto mo umunlad ang Pilipinas, dapat ang pagbabago magsimula sa'yo.

Alam ng lahat ng kakilala ko na bakla ako(hindi alam ng mga magulang ko  , pero gusto pa rin nila ako kayakap, gustong-gusto ko ng kayakap hindi lang lalaki bati babae, dahil  ang lalambot kasi mga boobs ng babae ang sarap kasi, naka turn on, kaya minsan pinapatagal ko ang pag yayakap ko dahil gusto ko mafeel ang mga boobs nila, parang gusto ko na bumalik sa pagkalalaki ko!pero sa mga lalaki naman kasi ang titigas ang katawan, lalo na kapag na na hahawakan ko ang mga titi nila, ang bilis mag turn on! bisexual yata ako pero ang alam ng mga babae balak ako, kaya advantage talaga ng pag-giging balak sa mga babae para pwede silang pagnasahan. pero may nililigawan kasi ako ngayon na lalaki, kaya balak mode muna.salamat sa lahat ng kayakap ko! i love you all!

Hi Sir Tablazon,Ako po yung nagpost last time dito sa TEF. Di po prank yun sir. Totoo po yun lahat. Masyado lang po atang naheighten ang emotions ko kaya nagtunog na prank. So ngayon magpapaka-normal na tao po ako sa post na ito.Minsan na po pala tayong nagkita. Nung di ko sinasadyang sumilip sa cubicle nyo sa Humanities kasi may hinahanap po akong kaibigan. Tumingin po kayo sa akin at sa sobrang gulat ko ay dali-dali akong umalis. I guess naoverwhelm po ako sa presence nyo kaya hanggang dito pa rin sa TEF ko kayo kinocontact.Sana nga po ay kayanin ng kalooban ko na harapin kayo someday. Ang lakas kasi ng dating nyo sir. Baka di kayanin ng tuhod ko at matumba na lang ako bigla.Madalas po pala akong bumisita sa Elbi lately. Last time nga lang po ay nasa CDO daw kayo for a film fest. Sayang. Anyway, nakakatuwang nagreply po kayo sa post ko last time. Kung alam nyo lang kung gaano ako kaligaya na ako ay inyong napansin rin. Marami pong salamat pala oras nyo.Hanggang dito na lamang muli at maraming salamat.-38 Mutual Friends na pala, 200*-*8*0*, CAS

Mas magiging masaya sana imbis na para kang nagdudusa sa paggawa ng LRP kung hahayaan lang sana ang mga students na pumili ng topic kung saan sila interesado. May mga prof na sobrang arte, wala ng ibang ginawa kundi ireject ang mga topic na isina submit sa kanila. Hanggang sa wala ka ng choice, at gawan ng research paper ang kinuha mong topic na wala ka naman talagang interes gawin.Maswerte ako sa instructor ko sa ENG2, alam kong medyo lame ang isinubmit kong topic pero tinulungan nya ko kung pano ko mas mapapaganda ang research paper ko. Punong-puno sya ng mga suggestions at sobrang encouraging ng mga comments nya sa notecards ko at dahil dun, talagang sinipag ako during the LRP process at maaga ko itong natapos.Sa huli, masasabi kong na enjoy ko ang paggawa ng LRP dahil kay Maam Manzano. Salamat Maam.eL aR Pi,2013, CAS

At kapag walang tao sa paligid, di ko mapigilang ikiskis ang aking sarili sa hook na naka-usli. Para bang personal glory hole ko to na nagdudulot ng matinding sarap. At sa bawat dikit, akoy napapapikit... Maraming salamat sa kung sino mang arkitekto, inhenyero, karpentero o putang inang tuberong naglagay ng bakal sa pwestong yun.

Para sa mga taong dumayo sa pinakamamahal naming unibersidad upang ma-enjoy ang Feb Fair pero di sumusunod sa rules and regulations ng UPLB,MGA WALANG HIYA KAYO.Akala niyo naman kung sino kayo umasta, makapagkalat ng mga plastic at whatever ng pinagkainan niyo sa lower field ng Freedom Park. Sobrang nakakairita. Nagmukha tuloy babuyan yong buong dating napakalinis na greenery field. Yong feeling na, hello? Informed kayo about Feb Fair pero sa No Littering at No Smoking policies, hindi? Wow lang. May penalties kaya yon. Kung tititigan niyo yong sa may grandstand, maiisip mo na lang, teka, may bagyo bang dumaan na hindi ko naramdaman?Next Feb Fair, please lang pakiayos na po.

TEF pakipost naman, salamatLumabas na ang result ng board exam ng mga EE, 2 from UPLB ang nasa top 10, 6 from Mapua.Ano ang gusto ko iparating?. Humihina na ba ang kalidad ng UPLB, o gumagaling lang ang Mapua?. Tingin ko pareho. Humihina na ang kalidad ng pagtuturo sa UPLB kasi halos lahat ng teacher, lalo na sa CEAT ay wala naman ginawa kundi magpahirap sa estudyante nila. Ang madalas ko nga naririnig na daing ng mga EE ay parati sila nawawalan ng klase ng hindi nagsasabi ang teacher. Okay lang naman po sana magpahirap, pero ang nakakainis lang, yung mga teacher, nagpapahirap ng hindi naman nagtuturo ng tama. Okay lang hirapan ang exam, pero sana bago hirapan ang exam, siguraduhin muna nila na naipaintindi nila ng tama yung lesson sa mga estudyante nila. Ang nakakainis kasi, yung mga teacher, di naman nagtuturo ng tama, wagas magpahirap sa exam. Anong koneksyon nito sa kalidad ng edukasyon natin?, ayun, dumadami ang cheaters, dumadami ang nangongopya at nagkokodigo, at umuunti ang mga totoong natututo. Karamihan nagseself study na lang. Edi sana binigyan nyo na lang kami ng manual for the whole sem para di na tayo nagsasayangan ng oras sa pagpasok.

Alam ng lahat ng kakilala ko na bakla ako(hindi alam ng mga magulang ko  , pero gusto pa rin nila ako kayakap, gustong-gusto ko ng kayakap hindi lang lalaki bati babae, dahil  ang lalambot kasi mga boobs ng babae ang sarap kasi, naka turn on, kaya minsan pinapatagal ko ang pag yayakap ko dahil gusto ko mafeel ang mga boobs nila, parang gusto ko na bumalik sa pagkalalaki ko!pero sa mga lalaki naman kasi ang titigas ang katawan, lalo na kapag na na hahawakan ko ang mga titi nila, ang bilis mag turn on! bisexual yata ako pero ang alam ng mga babae balak ako, kaya advantage talaga ng pag-giging balak sa mga babae para pwede silang pagnasahan. pero may nililigawan kasi ako ngayon na lalaki, kaya balak mode muna.salamat sa lahat ng kayakap ko! i love you all!

Hi Sir Tablazon,Ako po yung nagpost last time dito sa TEF. Di po prank yun sir. Totoo po yun lahat. Masyado lang po atang naheighten ang emotions ko kaya nagtunog na prank. So ngayon magpapaka-normal na tao po ako sa post na ito.Minsan na po pala tayong nagkita. Nung di ko sinasadyang sumilip sa cubicle nyo sa Humanities kasi may hinahanap po akong kaibigan. Tumingin po kayo sa akin at sa sobrang gulat ko ay dali-dali akong umalis. I guess naoverwhelm po ako sa presence nyo kaya hanggang dito pa rin sa TEF ko kayo kinocontact.Sana nga po ay kayanin ng kalooban ko na harapin kayo someday. Ang lakas kasi ng dating nyo sir. Baka di kayanin ng tuhod ko at matumba na lang ako bigla.Madalas po pala akong bumisita sa Elbi lately. Last time nga lang po ay nasa CDO daw kayo for a film fest. Sayang. Anyway, nakakatuwang nagreply po kayo sa post ko last time. Kung alam nyo lang kung gaano ako kaligaya na ako ay inyong napansin rin. Marami pong salamat pala oras nyo.Hanggang dito na lamang muli at maraming salamat.-38 Mutual Friends na pala, 200*-*8*0*, CAS
Last saturday, we had a field trip for a GE subject. And it was the best day of my life, dahil sa buong araw na un, kasama ko ung crush ko hihi. Heres the story  . Before kami umakyat sa bus, sabi niya NV Pano ba yan, tayo magkatabi. Super kilig ko nun kahit I already knew the day before na siya makakatabi ko kasi kami lang ung walang close friend sa class. Tapos I replied, Ah sige haha, di ko kasi alam sasabihin ko haha kahit gusto kong sumigaw ng OMG TOTOO BA TO HUHU.Tapos during the trip, may mga moments na nagkikiskisan ung braso at legs namin habang umaandar ung bus, which is very nakakakilegs. I wanted to pretend nga na Im sleeping para makasandal ako sa kanya eh kaso di ko alam magiging reaksyon niya(or baka magalit  kaya I chose not to. And everytime bababa kami sa bus, syempre kami ung magkapayong, magkatabi kumain, tapos sabay ring babalik sa bus. Pero kahit sobrang ang lapit ko na sa kanya, nalulungkot rin ako kasi wala kaming picture together, ung by group lang meron. Nahihiya kasi talaga ako kahit sobrang dami kong gustong sabihin. Kaya ang plano ko magseselfie na lang kami sa last day of classes para masaya!! Un lang po salamat sa pagbasa niyo =  Hi po sayo!! =    (PS. not my real college   mekeni hotdog,2014,Business Administration

Mas magiging masaya sana imbis na para kang nagdudusa sa paggawa ng LRP kung hahayaan lang sana ang mga students na pumili ng topic kung saan sila interesado. May mga prof na sobrang arte, wala ng ibang ginawa kundi ireject ang mga topic na isina submit sa kanila. Hanggang sa wala ka ng choice, at gawan ng research paper ang kinuha mong topic na wala ka naman talagang interes gawin.Maswerte ako sa instructor ko sa ENG2, alam kong medyo lame ang isinubmit kong topic pero tinulungan nya ko kung pano ko mas mapapaganda ang research paper ko. Punong-puno sya ng mga suggestions at sobrang encouraging ng mga comments nya sa notecards ko at dahil dun, talagang sinipag ako during the LRP process at maaga ko itong natapos.Sa huli, masasabi kong na enjoy ko ang paggawa ng LRP dahil kay Maam Manzano.

Almost 4 years na kami ng boyfriend ko, sa UP ko rin siya nakilala. Graduating siya nung freshie ako pero naging kami lang nung nasa 3rd year na ako at nasa law school na siya. Masaya naman noong simula kasi kaibigan ko yung naging boyfriend ko. Kaso ngayon ang hirap na, halos wala na siyang oras sa akin. Naiintindihan ko naman yung time na para sa acads at pamilya niya, pero kahit mga kaibigan niya pinipili niya rin kesa sa akin. Yung tipong hindi siya willing bumangon sa weekends (kung kailan lang siya free makipagkita sana sa akin  kung ako yung nagyayayang lumabas at malalaman ko nalang na nung niyaya ng mga kaibigan, go siya agad. Hindi siya magpaparamdam ng ilang araw na minsan umaabot ng linggo tas pagkakausapin niya ko parang wala lang nangyari noong nakaraang linggo. Tapos palagi niya pa ako pinaghihintay ng ilang oras pag magkikita kami. Hindi na siya nag-iiloveyou at sobrang cold na niya na sa akin na pag sabihin niyang ﾓIngat kaﾔ sobrang saya na ng araw ko nun kasi yun nalang siguro ang pinaka-sweet na nasasabi niya sa akin lately, tipid pa. Basta mahirap kaya nga napasulat ako sa TDF. Ginagawa ko naman lahat ng makakaya ko para maging maayos ang relasyon namin. Feeling ko talaga hindi na niya ako gusto pero kapag tinatanong ko naman siya, sinasabi niya na gusto niya pa ako. At kahit sobrang hirap na nito, ay honestly ayaw ko pa ring bumitaw kasi gusto ko talaga siya. Kaso ang hirap na. Anong dapat gawin ko? Sorry sa kadramahan na to pero kailangan ko talaga ng advice. Salamat.Hopeless Romantic,6335, Arts & Letters

Last day ng beach house nun at niyaya ako ng kapatid kong maglunch doon kasi last day nga. Habang nasa pila, may guy and girl sa likod namin. Sobrang conyo ng lalaki, nakakainis. Tapos ipinagmamamalaki niya na nakapasok siya sa bracket B. Wala akong masyadong alam sa criteria for each bracket pero sa pananamit niya at mga kwento niya, kung merong bracket AA, dun siya nararapat. 3 1/2 na oras kaming pumila dun, so imagine the first hour na non-stop ang daldal niya. Nagkwento pa nga siya na bibilhan daw niya ng libro yung gf niya for her birthday, accounting book daw... Naisip kong ipakain sakanya ang buong accounting na libro para kahit saglit man lang, may katahimikan sa pila. Grabe talaga, kahit naglagay na ako ng earphones at nakinig ng music, naririnig ko pa rin siya. Bwisit. Paano kaya nakakayanan ng kasama niya yung ugali niya?Para kay sosyal dude na mas conyo pa sa mga estudyante ng Katipunan at Taft, ang sarap i-stapler ng bibig mo. Sana bago ka magkwento ng panggugulang mo sa STFAP (tama ba? , isipin mo na marami kang schoolmates na nakarinig ng success story mo to Bracket B and most likely, naramdaman nilang naisahan mo sila. Dinramahan mo lang and crap, and poof Bracket B ka na. Tangina. Lumayas ka ng UP please. Maraming mas deserving na makapasok sa UP kaysa sayo. Maraming salamat at umalis rin kayo ng friend mo 1 hour after naming pumila, at least may 2 1/2 hours kami ng katahimikan ng kapatid ko. Also, sana mag-open ang beachhouse somewhere sa UP or Katipunan or sa Maginhawa. Da best ang BBQ niyo!-Sarap ng Beach House BBQ,2009, Not from UPD
Mahal pa kaya niya ko?2 weeks na kaming break. Masaya pa rin ako [kahit papano] kasi friends pa rin kami. Nagtetext at nagchachat pa rin kami araw-araw. Lumabas pa nga kami nung isang araw para manood ng sine. Mahal ko pa rin siya. Alam niya yun. Pero di ko siya ma-spell. Di ko alam kung mahal pa rin ba niya ko o close friend na lang tingin niya sakin.Kinikilig ako pag siya ang unang nagtetext sakin ng musta? o good morning at pag siya ang unang nagsisimula ng chat namin sa facebook. One time nag-chat kami tapos in-ask niya ko mag-send ng selfie ko sa kanya. Di ko alam kung ano ibig sabihin nun. Pag miss ko siya humihingi rin ako ng selfie niya and pinagbibigyan niya rin naman ako. One time inaya ko siyang mag-Boni High Street kami minsan, tinanong niya ko agad kung kelan ko gusto.Ano sa tingin niyo guys? Gusto kong marinig mga opinyon niyo. Pakiusap, yung seryoso naman. Salamat.  PS. Pareho kaming isko.-Wonderwall,2009, Engineering
Nanood ako last night ng lantern parade, tapos may part pala dun yung mga nasalanta ng yolanda na taga UP-tacloban. I feel for them. Tama nga din naman lahat ng sinabi ni ate last night, kulang ang support, state subsidy, etc. Ang hindi ko lang matanggap is yung sobrang binaby yung mga taga UP-diliman students na mga taga Region 8. First of all, why mga taga reg8 lang? How about yung taga ibang region? I have a friend na taga Cebu, nasalanta siya, kaso di siya taga reg 8, kaya kebs lang. Second, fine, lets say isali na natin ang lahat na taga region 8 sa free food and stuff, pero ang rebracket? Gosh! I know people na from region 8 na rebracketed pero hindi naman nasalanta! Ano to? Mahiya naman kayo! Ibigay niyo sa mas nangangailangan yan! Naturingan pa naman na professional ang mga parents niyo!Rant kayo ng rant regarding the system na bulok yet you yourselves ay tinatake advantage ang situation! Nakakahiya! Pwe! Kaya nakikiusap ako sa OUR, pakiayos naman po ng system niyo, kawawa yung ibang hindi taga region 8 na nasalanta. Maraming salamat po and Merry Christmas!- WagMapagsamantala,2009, CS
Para sa ateng nag-post nito   sobrang pasasalamat ko sa yo    na-inspire akong maging totoo sa aking sarili.  Na-inspire at nabigyan ako ng pag-asa na may magmamahal din sa kin dahil tanggap niya/nila ako.  Thank you  Pero sa kasawiang palad, hindi pa rin ako out sa family ko.  Hirap eh.  Hindi pa rin ako ready mag-out. Gusto ko na sana pero ang nakakaalam lang ay yung mga kilala ko na nasa UP na sure ako hindi dadating sa mga magulang ko ang balita.Pero someday, sure ako, lalabas na din ako   one step at a time ^_^- TrueToYourHeartAngPegNiAte,2013, Engg
Para sa lab partner ko noong second sem nung isang taon. Di mo alam gaano ako kasaya nung ikaw naging lab partner ko nun. Yung sem bago yun nagsimula kitang naging crush. At nagpatuloy pa yun nang ilang sems. Pinigilan ko lang kasi alam kong walang patutunguhan yung feelings ko. Natakot na ko ma-friendzone uli. At pakiramdam ko mas bagay kayo nung isa nating classmate. Minsan medyo nakakaselos na pag inaasar kayong dalawa. Pero mas maganda at interesting sya. Salamat na lang sa pagiging inspirasyon. Pag naging kayo at ikakasal na kayo, balitaan nyo ko.-Veronika,2010, Engg

Tadhana nga namang pagsamahin pa tayo sa iisang kwarto noong field trip sa Philo 1 ngayong midyear. <3Noong unang parte ng semestre, wala talaga akong masyadong ka-close sa klase kasi tahimik lang ako at hindi masyado napapansin ng propesor kahit gusto kong magrecite kasi masyadong matangkad yung nasa harap ko at di kita ang nametag ko. Pero nang dumating ang field trip, BOOM! Hindi ko maipaliwanag kung paano tayo nag-click nalang bigla. Di ko aakalaing magkakaroon ako ng clingy friends. Kayo talaga ang nagpasaya ng buong midterm ko. Salamat sa lahat ng bonding moments, solicitation moments, sleepover moments, Just Dance moments, Raffy moments, #Bracket__KaNa moments, Killer moments, at sa lahat ng moments sa Philo 1 kasama ng ating napaka-gwapo at napaka-talinong propesor.   Kung alam ko lang na ganito pala tayo kapag pinagsama, nakipag-FC na agad ako sa inyo sa simula palang. Magtatapos na ang Philo 1, pero walang bibitiw! May susunod pang mga semestre!

I once was a really active and dedicated member of one of the religious groups in UPLB. That was, of course, until I tearfully confided to my leaders that I got raped by an acquaintance and they told me it was my fault because I associated myself with non-Christians.Ive been a fierce defender of womens rights and gender equality ever since. Oh and also an advocate of campus secularism.So hi, my once-dear leaders. Just so you know, you almost drove me mad with shame and guilt.

I really have to get this out of my chest now, or else no one will..Super magastos ang HUM2!! Okay lang yung matrabaho kasi well ganun naman talaga sa school pero yung sobrang daming required panoorin, na kadalasan ay may mga pahabol pa, nakakaleche lang sa feelings.. Isa pa, sana pumili din yung department ng THEME sa musical performance na nakakamotivate naman para samin, I mean yes maganda naman ang songs ng Apo Hiking, Beatles at Michael Jackson pero sana may singer naman tayo na sumikat from 2000-2014.. Feel ko mas awesome pag ganun..Yun lang naman, pero thank you sa easy exams, thats the great thing about HUM2.. <3TheTheaterActor,2012, CDC
Para kay kuyang ComSci grad,Thanks for a wonderful week. I feel like Ive met one of the most amazing guys in my life. I wish I met you at a different time kasi sobrang bata ko pa for you. Youre working now and you probably should have a wife and kids at this point, pero sabi mo nga pihikan ka. Sobrang nag-enjoy ako sa mga napag-usapan natin, sa mga kwento mo at sayo... yung buong ikaw.Siguro kung hindi tayo majujudge ng society, pwede sana but no. You will always have your own hesitations and I will always be impulsive. In those times na nagkakausap tayo, those stolen times from the reality, sobrang natutuwa ako.I wish I could say more than I like you, but I cant and I know you wont let me.Sana kasi 20 something na lang ako.Miss Iska, CEAT,2012, Chemical Engineering.

Sana ma-post to para maayos na ang lahat.Hi. Isa ko dun sa mga nagtweets ng di maganda. And kahapon, I decided to reach Ms. Ranada through one of her friends kase nga hindi ko siya makausap through Facebook and Twitter. Yung Facebook nya ay masyadong private at yung Twitter naman ay deactivated na. So ayun na nga. I sent her a message and in behalf of UPLB community nagsorry ako sa mga nasabi nung iba lalo na yung mga curse words at threats. And ito yung naging reply niya via text message through her friend Sino siya? Ang bait naman -  Sabihin mo wag na siyang magsorry kahit na basher pa siya. I understand them. Thanks nga rin pala sa pag-intindi sakin   Medyo mahaba yung naging usapan namin ng friend niya through Twitter pero tinetext niya kay Irene yung messages ko. According sa kanya, habang nag-uusap kami, Irene feels a lot better now and that she feels no hate towards the people of UPLB. Naiintindihan niya raw kung bakit hindi tayo nagalit sakanya and dapat daw nirephrase niya yung sinabi niya para hindi siya na-misunderstood and alam niya rin daw na lahat tayo ay may kanya-kanyang way of thinking. And kahapon, na-settle na namin yung issue between us. Gusto kong ma-post to dahil gusto kong i-encourage yung iba kong schoolmates na nagtweet din ng di maganda sakanya na magsorry. Nag-sorry na siya guys, sana gawin natin yung part natin. Nagkamali siya, oo at aminado naman na siya. Pero may mali rin naman tayo, actually mas malaki pa nga yung mali natin kasi dapat hindi na natin pinatulan. Magnew-new year guys. Bagong buhay ;-  Kung isa kayo dun at nagdecide na kayo na mag-forgive at magsorry din sakanya, magcomment lang kayo dito at imemessage ko kayo ^^ PS Promise guys. Masarap sa feeling na nakapagsorry ka at wala ka nang sama ng loob at pati yung ok ka na rin dun sa other party. Nagkaron pa ko ng panibagong friend. So guys, cmon ^^Advance Happy New Year!!!! <3- Xiao Lu, CHE, 2012-*****, BS Nutrition

*Before anything else, please donﾒt judge me. This is me, falling in love and just that. Well, falling in love with two people for that matter.This is an epilogue because this is the second part of the ending of my story. Yes, there is a third part and Iﾒll tell you all about the third part. This is my most precious and most kept secret.I worked as a support employee for a company which supports another company with employees who happen to validate the reliability of their data. My team generally assist them in sending and making sure that data is correct on their end. I graduated from the College of Engineering, UP Diliman and somehow my undergraduate degree proved to be very useful in my chosen career at that time.My and my Green Archerﾒs story started when we were assigned as partners (fate is really playful a green archer and a UP Maroon . I was already working for around six months when she entered my team. She was introduced to my team and was assigned as my apprentice; I was tasked to assist her during her first week on the job. At first, I was actually shy in helping her (which she usually describes that I failed to assist her . I was just really shy in trying to start a conversation with her thus also failed to assist her during her first days in the team. And no, I did not like her at first, not even a speck! Itﾒs just that I am not a conversation kind of guy. For all I know, I might have disliked her due to the fact that she was an archer. Peace my green archer friends. The week passed by without promising events. Nothing really happened. Sometimes, she would ask questions on what to do about her assigned tasks and I answered, and that was it. No other conversation. Not even the initiative to help her. But Friday came, her 5th day on the team, and she was pressured to do her final task which I remember was to make a report or presentation of her experiences in the team. And that started our interesting conversations. Conversations that would last three years and four months. Office chat, Yahoo Messenger, FB Chat, now FB Messenger, SMS, phone calls, personal conversations, shouting conversations, ﾓpatagoﾔ conversations, and the like ﾖ every type of them.A simple question I asked when we were seated beside each other in our first out of town team building was (and when I was feeling a bit dizzy  ﾓPwede sumandal?ﾔ and she immediately said ﾓYesﾔ. Oh, and I died that day. LOL! I died not because of the sandal, but because of the many liters of beer, in tandem with other sorts of liquor I drank. I always said that I drank too much to impress the other girl, but no, it was for you. To that maximum extent of irony, it backfired on me ﾖ thus my death that night. I will never forget that sandal. That sandal that I always treasured and kept in my shallowest memories.That night, whenever you told me your side of the story, you always said that you were there when I fell on the floor and you were the one who called for help. That night, I thought maybe, we were really fated. Fated to be close to each other. Destined to be together. With only one thing that hinders us ﾖ our situation or should I say, my situation. Yes, I am in a relationship four years and counting and the three years we were together were in overlapping terms.A week has passed since the sandal moment. I deviated from who I really was and I tried to confirm myself on what happened that night. I did not want to be called a drunk loser during inuman sessions and so I talked to everybody and that included you. But back in my mind, I kept thinking about that sandal. I used our office chat just to talk to you. And yes, I was beginning to like you. And I mean really like you. Another week passed, another inuman session came, I invited you to join, and you said yes. Wow, and I said, I like this girl already, I even treated you to pizza. Hooray for the pizza, I was one step closer to you. And so we talked beside the pool. And we talked over text messages when we got to our respective homes. And we talked when you were window shopping while I was in my friendﾒs house trying to elude my girlfriend.I know I was getting closer to you. And not a single day, that we did not talk. Yes, there was a full three week period that I did not see my girlfriend because we were texting and I was guilty. Guilty of falling for you. Guilty of all the sins that my past generation has done. And so around five months into our little relationship of everyday conversing, we told each other of the truth of our feelings. Feelings that we knew at the very start would happen. The kind of love that we thought we could achieve despite the circumstances. And we told each other that we love each other. I had to think. I thought for a week. My love for you was not deep, not deep at all. I might have been just infatuated with you. I may be longing for the sweet moments in a relationship ﾖ the first hug, the first holding hands, the first dates, and the first kiss. Another week has past, and I decided to let you go. I thought to myself that you deserve better. And you accepted it.But, three days after, we were already exchanging text messages again. We cannot let go. We didnﾒt want to. We cannot fathom the idea of losing our moment ﾖ our moment that might be it. Our destined moment. We didnﾒt want to regret passing each other out. So we decided to pursue this forbidden relationship. This relationship that lasted three years and four months full of love, adventure, sorrow, anger and hate.The next year and a half, we explored ourselves. We tried to know each other better. Who we were in the past, who we are in the present and who we want to be in the future. And in our job, I was happy you were there. I was happy to had coffee nights, fastfood breakfasts and baon lunches with you. Yes, there were a lot of times that we argue on the things like palibre naman, wala kang pera, or busy ako or ikaw. These things were just a small matter.And the second year was the most critical. We had our adventures ﾖ the beach adventure, the cold weather adventure, the date adventure, the coffee sessions adventure, the overnights and the intimate ones. It was also critical because our relationship raised a level higher to the extent that we were very intimate. It was also critical because, you were already starting to get tired of the situation. The numerous days that I would regrettably said that I will not be able to talk to you, or the days that we watched movies where I would hide behind large outfits or dates that would only take around 30 minutes or so because I was afraid people I know would recognize us. I always had that regret to not take you to a full date. I was always afraid that youﾒll leave me eventually. And I am sorry for that. I am sorry for everything. Things became a little rough. Sometimes we get to shout at each other. Shout bad words at each other. There were a lot of times that I wanted to leave you and yes that happened but you eventually got us back together. There were also a lot of times that you left me but I got us back. And then, I left my job. I left to a new environment. I said to myself, this might be it. This might be the time that we can leave each other. But, it went the other way. All the conversations became a needing remedy to what we feel being in a distant workplace. Every week, we see each other, we took overnights and slept together. And I am sorry for those times that I was not able to take you to dates. To the places youﾒve read from the internet that were very good places to visit and eat. I knew, and always knew that you really had to go visit those places with me. To my regret, only a handful of those places, have I brought you. Remember this though, those places we went were very special and I see to it that Iﾒd only visit those places with you and no one else. Yes, this is true. On our third year, it became a little more rougher than our second year. We had fights that were really, really bad. Oh my, I remember, we were shouting at the biggest avenue in the Metro and exchanging regretting words. I am sorry. Rest assured, during our last four months, I changed. I really, really changed for you. I never got out of my very short temper anymore. I always had to take on your requests. Every request you wanted except on those days that were prohibited. And I am really sorry for that. Sorry for all the hassle. I still love you now. And I will love you still.On our last two weeks, you left me with just a text. When I tried to talk to you, you shut me out. You got tired of the situation. I didnﾒt even got to see you. You said that you were already falling for someone else. At first I did not believe it. But when I kept bugging you, it became clear to me that it was true. And anger placed me with a very confused mind. I kept thinking on what to do. I didnﾒt want to choose you over her if this new development forced me too. Iﾒd want it that we realize it by ourselves. Realize that we are for each other.  And on the last week, we had our last fight. A fight that led us to our real downfall. That led your graceful hate on me which I hated you too. I needed my anger on you to grow so that it would be easy for me move on. I got lost. I got lost in my way. Anger never subsided in my heart. I had to do what I have to do and so we met one last time. I apologized. I never explained anymore. I returned everything that reminded me of you. I left our meeting place (oh, I want you to know that I really wanted to meet in our usual place but you chose another one  with clenched fist ﾖ I did not want to lose you. I wanted to be with you. But I did not want to go back to you with those feelings. And I thought I guess you were right. I think itﾒs time for us to move on our separate ways. I cried a lot. I cried when I was alone. Itﾒs around three weeks now, and I still think about you a lot. I wondered what would happen if it was you I chose. Heck, Iﾒd chose you now if given the chance. But yes, I know, itﾒs too late. Too late the hero in me choosing you. One thing though that Iﾒll never forget, you really had me. You really had me hurt really, really bad when you gave our ﾓsandalﾔ to your new friend. What an insensitive person you are. And it still hurts when I remember you explained ﾓEh, wala lang naman yun. Friend ko lang siya.ﾔ This I say, putang ina naman oh. The conversations we had may have been around 50% of our relationship, but I was really really happy even if you did not feel it that way. Even I was angry or busy, at the end of the day, having to talk to you was a relief. A great relief that you were always there. That you were always listening. For those three or so years, I know that there were real and happy times. And why in the world would you leave me to dust when I have loved you more than her? Why? And why when I changed for you just like you asked me too? I know I donﾒt have the right to ask you now, but my feelings and my love demand it. Even if our worlds were distant and our space was complicated, we promised each other that we will never leave our sides. I held on to that promise. And I still do and I thank you for everything. P.S. I love you.P.P.S. If in a million chance that this TDF post will reach you, my Green Archer, please listen to Kontra Tiempoﾒs ﾓBe Near Meﾔ. I donﾒt want to say goodbye, just listen to the song. If the stars will align for us, Iﾒd be willing to start a new life with you. But for now, Iﾒm sorry I failed us. (I apologize but I had to borrow the person in the videoﾒs statement. P.P.P.S. The third part of this story is the end of the three month rule. I hope that at day ninety-two, we are better persons. Itﾒs ninety-two days considering the 31ﾒs of the passing months.

A month ago, sinend ko itong post na to   months ago, I was truly hurt. Then I realized that youre just physically attracted to me. Ive accepted the fact that you dont have any feelings for me. Amidst the things that I gave up for you, you still dont care. Because you are you--an asshole.Everyone is telling me that I should forgive you. No. I wont. If theres one person that I should forgive for what happened, thats myself and not you.I have forgiven myself for all the non-sensical things Ive done just to get your attention, just to have you back. Then I moved on  Now Im back on track! Thanks TDF!GreenT2006, Engineering

I had a one night stand. It was my first time. You pushed me, and I relented.Fuck our images, we had our good boy/girl images to hide our lust. Were never gonna get caught, as long as I dont see you again.Fuck you, dont take off your condom when you want to finish. Withdrawal doesnt always work, and we both know were not yet responsible adults.And fuck me, because I had to take nordette as emergency contraception (being the paranoid that I am . It pretty much fucked up my body for a day, but at least Im sure that I wont be pregnant. Btw, this isnt abortion.To the iskos and iskas, know your contraceptives. Responsible sex comes with a cost.And to you. Thanks for making me moan, but Iﾒm never doing it with you again. You just risked my career, and Iﾒm not gonna fuck that up. Fuck somebody else.DiMakabasagPinggan,2010, Science

Nag-sorry na siya guys, sana gawin natin yung part natin. Nagkamali siya, oo at aminado naman na siya. Pero may mali rin naman tayo, actually mas malaki pa nga yung mali natin kasi dapat hindi na natin pinatulan. Magnew-new year guys. Bagong buhay ;-  Kung isa kayo dun at nagdecide na kayo na mag-forgive at magsorry din sakanya, magcomment lang kayo dito at imemessage ko kayo ^^ PS Promise guys. Masarap sa feeling na nakapagsorry ka at wala ka nang sama ng loob at pati yung ok ka na rin dun sa other party. Nagkaron pa ko ng panibagong friend.

We were an almost-couple during highschool. We drifted apart. Then came UP. Magkaiba tayo ng kurso, but you forced yourself back into my life. It was the best two years. We were inseparable. Young and in-love, I would flake my friends, sometimes my GE classes, just so I could spend more time with you. You would playfully carry me while it drizzles, during those times when we had to walk through the flooded parts of the campus, despite my efforts to stop you and pretend to be mad at you because people were staring. There was one sem when you would patiently wait for me for 3 hours everyday, just so you could hug me goodbye before I go home. We never missed a lantern parade, tanong ko pa, ﾓaattend pa rin ba tayo together after 10 years?ﾔ You were certain, you said yes. Youﾒre not the monthsary-bouquet-of-flowers-and-all-that-shit kind of guy, but you made me feel special everyday with the random things you say and do. You would sing for me just to make me laugh. You would tell me how lucky you are that youﾒre able to hug me anytime you want. I would give you one post-it everyday with some random cheesy, frequently nonsense, note. It was not a perfect relationship. We would have quarrels over the most trivial of things, but we would always, always work it out afterﾅuntil one day. Youﾒll always be my favorite ex. Thank you for the memories. LunaLG 2009 Engineering

  please post this, I really need help.]---Look, I have a condition called borderline personality disorder. The perks that come with it include having an irrational fear of abandonment and unstable relationships with someone.This is a bit long but please bear with me. I really need your opinion on this.---I met someone here in UP due to serendipity (we were classmates in every WF class we had . Even if we had absolutely no form of connection before, we became good friends in just a mater of time. In all honesty, this was the first real and proper form of friendship I have ever had because I was bullied during the length of my high school days. I was thrilled to finally experience this friendship thing people are talking about. We honestly had a really great time hanging with each other --mind you, it was an awful lot of time.But things started to change.Maybe its because we literally have zero mutual friends. Maybe its because he was quite popular in his high school and I was just a nobody in mine. Maybe its because we have different courses and come from different colleges and thus have different paths to take. Maybe we were like tangent lines, once together and fated to part forever. Maybe its just my BPD condemning me to not have a lasting friend in life.However, thanks to my BPD, irrational fears of abandonment set in and every vacation we had (long weekends, Christmas break, Holy Week , these fears only worsen and cause me to fall into ever worsening depression. I always come up with excuses for him to hang with me a bit longer, or to meet during the vacation just to hang. It seemed to work for me. But this summer vacation really hit me hard. It was just too long for my weird mind to handle.My psychiatrist advised me that in order to recuperate with this, I have to accept the fact that hell not be there with me all the time and try forget and dissociate everything that will remind me of him. Its a bitter thought, but I think it may work. But, as with all advices, it is easier said than done.Its been a month since I last saw him and I avoid texting/chatting him for as long as I can muster. But its been like hell. I am saddened by the fact that I cant preenlist/prerog the same classes with him anymore like we used to. I am saddened by the fact that we cant hang together. I am saddened that the most remarkable friendship I have will fall into oblivion. I never thought that my first real friendship will perhaps be my last.If youve reached this point, bless your heart. But I ask you How do you really break up with your best friend?---(I know he hardly visits this page, but let me take this opportunity. Note to him A million thanks will not suffice whatever friendship youve made me experience. You were like the brother I never had. We had a good run. You are honestly the best person I have had the fortune to meet; you do not deserve a psycho like me. You deserve the best in the world and not some runt who does not even know the dynamics of his own brain. Ill try my best to avoid you, but please do not think that it is your fault. I take full responsibility. Let me suffer the consequences alone.Goodbye.	Cant remember to forget you	2012	Economics

(Please report concerns like this TO THE PROPER AUTHORITY. To the owner of the phone, the confessor will send you a message. Hi, TDF Admins!! I submitted a confession here yesterday under the category LOST AND FOUND. Its about a phone that we found in CASAA and we were really aiming to return it to the person within the week. Unfortunately, we havent seen it posted here yet. Is there a way to find it among the hundreds of confessions and post it tonight?  Btw, we chose to post it here because we want our identities disclosed and theres a tendency that our friends make fun of our posts and stuff. I hope you can help us find the owner by posting our confession. Thank you so much! PS. We cant upload our own photo in the confession so here are the photos we took of the phone.

I had a lab instructor na sobrang hate ko noon. As in sobrang sinusumpa ko siya kasi sobrang OC at ang arte niya. Sobrang judger pa niya. There came a time na nag-aaral na pala siya as a masters student sa UPD. And nagkataon lang, nandito na rin ako sa Diliman. Hindi ko lang alam bakit pero bigla na lang siya nag-out sa akin, telling me that he had a boyfriend and shit like that. Sabi niya kasi, he was quite comfortable with me now kasi hindi niya na ako naging student and Im his only gay student.Then nung nag-break sila nung jowa niya, he was really sad. Tipong no sex shit mode talaga si kuya. Madalas niya akong yayain for sex noon. Pero ayaw ko talaga kasi parang ang awkward namang makipagsex ka sa dati mong prof diba? Pero sobrang naging batak and yummy niya na that I would really want to have sex with him pero nahihiya lang ako. Ayun. Never naman ako nakipagsex sa kaniya. Nakahanap rin siya ng iba ngayon. And Im honestly happy for him. Super thankful ako that he found someone better than his ex. And as for me, eto lola mode pa rin. Hindi na yata ako magkaka-boyfriend dahil sa pagpaparaya ko lagi. - ChukChakChenes,2010, CSSP
I have the hots for my dad.Putangina! I know that its wrong and creepy pero gusto kong makipag sex sa tatay ko. I sometimes go through his dirty clothes sniff them (usually his boxers  then masturbate, Im a guy (yes I know fucked up ako . I love my dad and I would do anything for him, he has been through a lot and probably this is the reason why I fell for him. Masakit mn isipin pero gusto ko nang umalis sa bahay (fuck yumiyak na ako .Right now my dad is only 37 years old but he looks like 20. He got my mother pregnant with my older brother when he was only 15 and my mom was 20, my mom is never around because she works abroad and goes home only after 4-5 years and stays home after 3 months. So for 15 years si daddy lang yung nakilala kong magulang (ewan ko lng sa sa kuya kong weirdo . I have been questioning my feelings for my dad since I was in high school, and now that Im in  one of the most liberated colleges in the Philippines I have this feeling that what Im feeling is not wrong, though deep down it is the most fucked up of feelings a person could experience. So I try to stay late and do org stuff or do almost anything just so that I dont have to go home while my dad is still awake. Thank god my dad leaves earlier than me in the morning.I have a very loving girlfriend and our relationship is the only reason why Im restraining myself not to do something stupid like seducing my dad. (I think my dad is gay/bisexual or his a sex addict  Someday if I cant take it any longer, I will rape my dad.I love him so much.daddys boy 2010 Arts & Letters
Im about to hit the big three-zero and under pressure from my family to get married and have my own family.Ive never had a long-term relationship. Im the kind of girl who loves so much but always seem to end up alone. Im the proverbial girl who always fall for the guy bestfriend, the lady that most guys are comfortable to hang out with as a buddy but not more than that.While in UPD, I fell in love with a guy for four years but I was friendzoned. I even won a date with an exchange student crush who stood me up. People say Im good-looking but I intimidate men. Nakakatakot ako? I cant figure out why.Now, Im seriously thinking of signing up on online dating sites, meet-ups etc just to get my family off my case and of course, to also fulfill my dream of having my own family. Im having second thoughts though. Anyone who has tried it, can you give me some tips? Thanks! Bridget Jones 2001 CS, not my real college
Recent UPD graduate here. Now, currently a first year medical student in UP Manila. I have connections with the faculty and staff at UPCM so I asked one of them to let me practice on cadavers, the dead bodies that are meant for dissection. I was given an old woman. Its the first time Ive seen a naked woman in real life. Its the first time Ive seen boobs in real life (in the flesh .And suddenly, I feel so fucking pathetic. What guy makes it past undergrad and into medical school, never to even lay eyes upon a girls body until he sees a dead one? Thats the epitome of being a loser.My whole life Ive been seen as an inanimate object by girls. Sure theyll want to hang out with me from time to time but nobody wants to ever touch me. Im just a distraction to them, a friend but not a lover. Maybe its because Im short, a bit dark, and have an incurable baby face. Maybe its because Im soft spoken and shy, and women dont like that.I dont know. Whatever it is, I hit rock bottom today upon seeing that body. It just triggered a massive wave of sadness. I dont want to die alone, but at age 22 and no experience Im already well on my way. Suicide is a daily thought (no serious planning, but Ill probably get to that stage soon . Anyway. Started crying while writing this, so Im going to finish here and wash up. Thanks for reading.-Overachiever,2010, UPCM8/25/2014 214400

To ALL VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ABUSE WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOICE OUT. Confess what those perpetrators and batterers have done to you! Iparamdam natin sa lipunan na maraming biktima ng pang-aabuso. Hi everyone. I hope this gets posted since this might be my last post. For the past year, I have accepted the fact that I am HIV +. I never got tested but I am experiencing A LOT of symptoms that are common to people living with HIV. I really hate the stigma. I can really still feel it. I hope that someday, everyone will not judge those people living with HIV. As I catch my breath while I type this post, I look back at my first year in UP Diliman. I am really thankful because I had the chance to study inside this beautiful campus and interact with intelligent beings. I started writing a diary on my Facebook account by messaging myself every night to highlight the good things that I experience every single day. Maybe someday, someone can edit and write a book based on my daily entries. Hehe... Because of my acceptance of death, I became more thankful and appreciative of the things around me. I dont know what else to say... I think I wrote already almost everything I that wanted to say on my daily entries thats why I really dont know what else to say in this post... I just wish that those who think that they are HIV + to get tested. Dont be like me. This acceptance also made me think whether or not I have regrets with the things I have done from the past. Do I regret that ONE time I messed up? A bit. Well, yeah because my dream of becoming filthy rich and successful wont push through anymore. I also will miss my family and this lovely campus. My biggest regret is that I kept all of this from my family. But because I believe in reincarnation, Im excited to die and start a new life again. I gave up to this disease. I just cant handle being judged by other people. I am ready for that opportunistic disease that would end this life of mine. Sorry I cant write something so emotional and fancy. Im just not that type of person. Im just really thankful for having a lot of time to prepare myself.I just have some questions that I need to ask before I end this post and patiently wait for Death.1. If you believe in God, why are you afraid to die?2. Whats the whole point of accumulating so much wealth?3. Why are there  lot of fame whores in this planet?4. Why must we all die? This reincarnation things the only reason why Im not asking this question....I guess I havent taken the classes that would teach the answers to these questions. You dont need to answer them. I just wanted to let all of this out of my mind. Thank you for reading this confusing post. See you all someday!  Hello, Goodbye2013, Undisclosed-- We asked What is your message for TDF?Hi everyone, I really felt so happy while I type this post. At least I (this post  can be remembered for a few days right?While I play this Beatles playlist, I just felt so excited for death. Parang gusto ko magpadespedida party ah. Shet, mixed emotions. Medyo kinakabahan ako maospital and all. Medyo sure na rin ako sa HIV status ko. 2 classmates ko sa highschool ang naospital na at nagkapneumonia yung isa at nagka brain disease naman yung isa. May something kasi sila. Nung highschool, they were booked by old gay men kaya na infect sila.   Why did I not write this there? Well, medyo nakakahiya lalo na sa school na pinanggalingan ko nung high school. This is an important issue, maybe you guys could somehow help stop this child prostitution issue. Hindi ko na pinost since magugulo lang yung good bye post ko sa TDF haha... Bakit parang ang saya ko kahit mamamatay nako? IDRK. Baliw na ata ako eh. Serious issue yung prostitution ah. Mamatay man ako(well, mukhang mamamatay na nga  May gay tv host comedian pa nga na nagpabook sa classmate ko eh. Kayo na bahala dito. These are all secrets but oh well. THANKS A LOT! Ang hirap talaga huminga , shit. ALSO, dont post this part sa tdf post ko ah! My classmates might know this is me. Post niyo kapag nabalitaan niyong patay nako. Justice para sa mga naiinfect na minors!

2nd sem na. OF na ako pero hanggang ngayon wala pa rin akong best friend o close friend. O kahit sinong kasama na kakain ng lunch o tatambay sa FPark ganun. Lagi nalang ako mag-isa tuwing lunch o dinner. Kaya gusto ko nga sumali sa org para man lang ma-enjoy ang college life kaso bawal. Tuwing makikita ko ang blocmates ko, smile lang, ok na. Walang conversation.  Lalo pag nakikita ko sila, ang sasaya nila. Nao-OP ako. Kaya nga gusto ko lumipat sa Diliman para atleast may kakilala ako dun. Ang lungkot ko lang. Sana naman kausapin nila ko.

Feb 14 during Mayonnaise concert.dahil nga nag-conduct kami ng isang activity sa org namin at late na ito natapos kumain muna kami sa labas at umuwi then nagpahinga at bumalik ulit sa FPark para manuod ng concert ng Mayo. Pagdating namin sa FPark excited na excited na ako, fan kasi ako ng Mayo.Ayan tugtog na sila then habang masayang masaya ako tumatalon sabay sa musika napansin ko may kalapit kami and napansin ko si crush pala yun! I mean yung taong mahal ko! Kaso nung tumagal napansin ko nakasandal sya sa isang guy tapos may hawak na gift, kasama pala nya boyfriend nya <///3 Ang sakit lang nun men, para sakin, lalo sa mga single na katulad ko. nawala na yung energy ko para manuod ng concert. nagtext nalang ako sa iba kong tropa kung nasan sila para sa kanila na lang ako sumama at nang hindi ko na makita si crush/mahal na masaya sa feeling ng iba. Pinilit ko nalang enjoyin ang concert ng Mayo sa gitna ng crowd that night.After concert matutulog na ko pumasok na naman sa isip ko ung nangyari kanina, yung may kasama syang iba. Na-realize ko na masayang-masaya naman sya sa feeling nung guy, kitang-kita yung ngiti nya, masaya silang dalawa sa kinalalagyan nila. At if ever naman, kunwari, maging kami nung girl, baka hindi ko sya mapasaya tulad ng ganoon, or baka hindi nya ko mapasaya tulad din ng ganoon so ang naconclude ko ay baka nga may darating na tao na para talaga sa akin na makapagpapasaya sakin, at sa side ko, makapagpapasaya sa kanya, at ang taong yun marahil ay hindi si crush.wag na nating pilitin ang mga bagay na marahil ay imposible, accept the fact na hindi lahat ng gusto nating mga bagay, pangyayari or tao ay makukuha natin. Nakikita mo naman silang dalawa na masayang-masaya eh itigil na ang pagpapantasya na mas magiging masaya sya kung maging kayo. matutong magsacrifice at magtiis. matutong mag-let go (naks, parang naging kami ni crush ah? . oo, mag-let go ng feelings. malay nyo andyan lang ang tunay na nagmamahal sa inyo, wala naman talaga kasi yan sa itsura, mararamdaman at mararamdaman mo lang talaga kung ano ang pagmamahal. wag na maging bitter sa mahal mo kung may mahal siyang iba. tandaan mo kung mahal mo at masaya siya sa kinalalagyan nya, dapat maging masaya ka na rin.Kaya crush, sana tumagal kayo ng mahal mo hanggang forever, masaya naman kayo sa isat isa kayat pagbutihan nyo pa. Wag kayong magba-baby ng maaga ha? Chos.Im not bitter anymore, Im syrupy sweet. - ParamoreLatigo,2012, CAS

2nd sem na. OF na ako pero hanggang ngayon wala pa rin akong best friend o close friend. O kahit sinong kasama na kakain ng lunch o tatambay sa FPark ganun. Lagi nalang ako mag-isa tuwing lunch o dinner. Kaya gusto ko nga sumali sa org para man lang ma-enjoy ang college life kaso bawal. Tuwing makikita ko ang blocmates ko, smile lang, ok na. Walang conversation.  Lalo pag nakikita ko sila, ang sasaya nila. Nao-OP ako. Kaya nga gusto ko lumipat sa Diliman para atleast may kakilala ako dun. Ang lungkot ko lang. Sana naman kausapin nila ko. Masaya din naman ako kasama eh. ; Sana bago mag-Christmas may friends na ako.  Ikaw, pwede ka bang maging kaibigan? ; -ForeverAlone, CDC,2013

Feb 14 during Mayonnaise concert.dahil nga nag-conduct kami ng isang activity sa org namin at late na ito natapos kumain muna kami sa labas at umuwi then nagpahinga at bumalik ulit sa FPark para manuod ng concert ng Mayo. Pagdating namin sa FPark excited na excited na ako, fan kasi ako ng Mayo.Ayan tugtog na sila then habang masayang masaya ako tumatalon sabay sa musika napansin ko may kalapit kami and napansin ko si crush pala yun! I mean yung taong mahal ko! Kaso nung tumagal napansin ko nakasandal sya sa isang guy tapos may hawak na gift, kasama pala nya boyfriend nya <///3 Ang sakit lang nun men, para sakin, lalo sa mga single na katulad ko. nawala na yung energy ko para manuod ng concert. nagtext nalang ako sa iba kong tropa kung nasan sila para sa kanila na lang ako sumama at nang hindi ko na makita si crush/mahal na masaya sa feeling ng iba. Pinilit ko nalang enjoyin ang concert ng Mayo sa gitna ng crowd that night.After concert matutulog na ko pumasok na naman sa isip ko ung nangyari kanina, yung may kasama syang iba. Na-realize ko na masayang-masaya naman sya sa feeling nung guy, kitang-kita yung ngiti nya, masaya silang dalawa sa kinalalagyan nila. At if ever naman, kunwari, maging kami nung girl, baka hindi ko sya mapasaya tulad ng ganoon, or baka hindi nya ko mapasaya tulad din ng ganoon so ang naconclude ko ay baka nga may darating na tao na para talaga sa akin na makapagpapasaya sakin, at sa side ko, makapagpapasaya sa kanya, at ang taong yun marahil ay hindi si crush.wag na nating pilitin ang mga bagay na marahil ay imposible, accept the fact na hindi lahat ng gusto nating mga bagay, pangyayari or tao ay makukuha natin. Nakikita mo naman silang dalawa na masayang-masaya eh itigil na ang pagpapantasya na mas magiging masaya sya kung maging kayo. matutong magsacrifice at magtiis. matutong mag-let go (naks, parang naging kami ni crush ah? . oo, mag-let go ng feelings. malay nyo andyan lang ang tunay na nagmamahal sa inyo, wala naman talaga kasi yan sa itsura, mararamdaman at mararamdaman mo lang talaga kung ano ang pagmamahal. wag na maging bitter sa mahal mo kung may mahal siyang iba. tandaan mo kung mahal mo at masaya siya sa kinalalagyan nya, dapat maging masaya ka na rin.Kaya crush, sana tumagal kayo ng mahal mo hanggang forever, masaya naman kayo sa isat isa kayat pagbutihan nyo pa. Wag kayong magba-baby ng maaga ha? Chos.Im not bitter anymore, Im syrupy sweet. - ParamoreLatigo,2012, CAS
Grumaduate ako nang walang barkada sa hayskul; mga kaibigan ko noon ay paisa isa sa napakaraming barkada kaya marami akong friends pero wala ug tipong niyayaya ako kasama ang isang malaking barkada. Nagkagirlfriend rin ako dti noong hayskul kaso sobra akong naging dependent sa kanya, tipong siya na lamang ang makakapagpasaya sa akin, kaso bago kmi grumaduate nakipagbreak siya sa akin ayan wasak ang mundo ko, magisa ako nang mga panahon na yun, walang makausap dhil wala akong ibang kaclose, d rn naman ako open sa pamilya ko. Hirap na hirap ako noon pero pumasa ako sa UP kaya pwede na push na lang, umasa akong mas sasaya siguro ako. Sabi ko sa sarili ko ayan college na bagong buhay siguro, mas maraming opportunities na makipagkilala sa mga taong makakaintindi siguro sa akin. Di kasi ako yung tipo ng taong malakas ang loob, di rin mabilis para sa akin ang makipagusap sa iba, magstart ng conversation, at makipagkilala kapag di ako yung nilalapitan. Makalipas ang ilang buwan sa first sem ko bilang freshie ayan ang dami nang kaibigan ng iba, may mga barkada na sila, may mga grupo na sa mga block, may mga magkakasabay nang maglunch, samantalang eto pa rin ako, naghihintay na baka isang araw may ngingiti at magyaya sa akin na sumabay nang maglunch kasama sila, kaso di pa to nangyayari. Hanggang ngayon magisa akong kumakain sa CASAA, AS steps, AS lobby, di ko na alam kung may mali sa akin o ano, pagkatapos ng klase ko magdyidyip na agad ako para makatakas sa campus, naiinggit ako sa mga taong napakaraming kaibigan e. Lagi na lang akong mag-isa. Sa college ko pa man din napakaraming clique, nasabi ko na rin sa sarili ko na sana masama man lang ako sa isa kaso hindi e parang kaiba ako, parang ayos lang ako sa lahat kaso di talaga ako pwedeng mabilang sa isa dahil iba ako sa kanila. Di ko alam kung ako lang nakakaranas nito. Di na ako masaya sa buhay ko, gusto kong umulit, lumipat sa ibang university kasi baka dun maging mas masaya ako o ano. Kelangan ko lang ng kaibigan kahit di na sa malaking grupo, kahit isa lang, yung makakausap, mapagsasabihan ng mga bagay bagay. Sana sa limang taon ko dito sa UP ay may makilala ako.FreshPeroUnhappy,2014, Business Administration
Help?Im very distracted no real long-term goals, no specific plan of actions for the present, and definitely no happiness. My mind is blurred and unclear, and i really feel so lost. Im unmotivated and scared of the future. I dont know what i want with life yet. I dont know what i want to do, and i want time to just stop. I need to think clearly. I want to study, but i dont. I want so many other things, but at the same time i really dont want to do it bcause those things seem so energy consuming. I want to both spend energy and consume it.My mind is so unclear im letting my feelings run all over me. My critical thinking is not functioning well and i cant even make coherent sentences and logical arguments.Im so self-centered, im liking and hating it. I dont know if im happy or not. Im only escaping...escaping...escaping towardt he little bits and pieces of entertainment and fake happiness.Sana psychological help can be more accessible. Sana may online services yung CTD-OSA.

I still love you, batch.Mahal pa rin kita. Makailang beses ko mang sabihing suko na ako at ayoko nang umasa, mahal pa rin kita. Makailang beses ka pang magbahagi sakin ng mga kwento sa sarili mong lovelife, mahal pa rin kita. Makailang beses ko mang makitang masaya ka sa presensiya ng iba, mahal pa rin kita. Makailang beses ko mang maramdamang nasasaktan kang umaasa sa kanya, mahal pa rin kita. Makailang beses ko mang maramdamang hindi ako ang kailangan mo, mahal pa rin kita.Bakit ba kasi? Bakit hindi ko magawang tumigil kahit maraming nagsasabing nagmumukha na akong tanga? Bakit sa halip na lumayo, ang nagiging role ko ay ang icomfort ka? Bakit sa halip na umayaw na ako, nakikita ko na lang ang sarili kong palapit muli ng palapit sayo? Bakit kahit alam kong siya ang gusto mo at sakin ikay mas mapapalayo, tinutulungan pa kita? Bakit?

Pero ang tagal na ng pinagsamahan namin e kaya mas matimbang pagiging kaibigan ko kaysa gender preference nila. Sobrang nalito ako. Pero pinapagulo ko lang pala lahat sa isip ko kasi sarado siya masyado. Wala na space para umintindi, wala na space para sa love. Bagsak talaga ako sa exam ng pag-ibig.Kung mali yung love nila, bakit mas masaya sila sa isat isa kesa nung opposite sex pa yung special someone nila. Bakit mas faithful sila? Bakit nai-imagine ko silang tumatanda at masaya ng magkasama? Ganito yata ang true love, parang yung nakikita ko sa kanila. Okay na lang na nagjo-jog kayo together sa Acad Oval. At di mapaghiwalay papuntang Area 2. Okay na rin na nagsusubuan kayo ng burger sa may Main Lib. Bago ko pa naman nalaman na kayo, ganyan na kayo e. Ang nagbago lang, yung kala ko bffs, ayun, sila pala talaga.I realized from my interactions with them, that if I close my eyes, understand with my mind and just feel with my heart, Ill see, that we all express the same love. Its really the same love after all. Walang ibang pagmamahal. Meron lang, pagmamahal. Yun na yun. Wag na natin husgahan. Wag na natin sukatin.Spread love!StraightButNotNarrow2008, Engineering

For Elmira Emery Medina of CEAT or CAS diko alam nagtanong-tanong lang ako.Mahal na kita ever since. Sobra. Yung feeling na nagi-Slow motion na ang paligid, fireworks and butterflies in the stomach chuchu. At first, Hindi ako na niniwala dun kasi napapanuod ko lang yun sa mga cliche romance themed movies and novels but I am wrong. Naramdaman ko ito sa iyo nuon pa man. Mahal na talaga kita kahit di pa tayo lubusang nagkakakilala. Sana nga magkita tayo at magkrus ang landas natin kasi lagi na lang tayong asymptote ee yung feeling na magkakasalubong n na tayo pero bigla kang liliko or babalik hindi naman at matuloy kapag magkasalubong tayo ee takot akong marinig mo ang pintig ng puso kong tanging ikaw lamang ang itinitibok. Mahal na kita sobra kahit hanggang tingin lang ako sayo. Mahal na kita kahit di pa tayo lubusang nagkakakilala. Mahal na talaga kita ng sobra. Sana mabasa mo ito dahil alam ko dito ko lang maibubulalas lahat ng nararamdaman ko para sayo. Mahal kita yun lang at sana maging magkaibigan tayo at sa susunod sana maging tayo na. Mahal na mahal kita.-MalakingPunoNgMahogany, CFNR, 20**

Hindi ito sakto pero parang ganito yung thought..Kapag nasa UP ka, iba ka. Marami kayong pwedeng matutunan sa UP. Pero ang pinakamahalagang hindi niyo dapat malimutan ay ang mahalin ang bawat ginagawa niyo. Pagmamahal sa kapwa, sa ginagawa niyo at sa iba pa. Dahil nasa UP kayo ngayon, ibig sabihin, matalino kayo, may utak kayo. Pero tandaan niyo na UP yan. Hindi lang U. May P pa. At yun, ay ang puso. Aanhin mo ang talino mo kung wala ka namang puso di ba? Utak at puso, tandaan niyo, dapat laging magkasama yan.UPM. Soc Sci II. Last meeting. (
